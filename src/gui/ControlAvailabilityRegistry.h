// The three-state control doctrine, as a mechanism (#5262 M3a).
//
// THE RULE, maintainer-ruled and binding: individual controls are never shown
// or hidden per radio. Every control renders in one of three states —
//
//   unavailable  the radio lacks the capability            dimmed, with a reason
//   inactive     supported by this radio, not engaged now  greyed
//   active       engaged                                   normal
//
// — and hiding exists only at APPLET granularity, where a radio-specific
// cluster moves to its own applet that hides wholesale. See
// docs/style/theme-style-guide.md §"Three-state controls".
//
// WHY A REGISTRY RATHER THAN MORE setVisible() CALLS. The per-site plumbing it
// replaces failed in two ways that are properties of the plumbing, not of any
// one site:
//
//   * A WIDGET BUILT AFTER THE SIGNAL never learns its state. MainWindow's
//     applyCapabilitiesToUi() runs on capabilitiesChanged; a pane added later
//     (Add Panadapter, a layout change, a lazily-built dialog page) missed it
//     and rendered in whatever state its constructor left it. The Calibration
//     page and DemoApplet both carried hand-written second pushes to paper over
//     this. Registration here APPLIES IMMEDIATELY, so a control is correct from
//     the moment it exists and the second push is unnecessary.
//   * ONE SUBSCRIPTION, NOT N. Each site connecting its own lambda to
//     capabilitiesChanged makes ordering between them undefined and makes "what
//     does this control depend on?" unanswerable without reading every lambda.
//     A control declares its predicate once, here.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not decide whether a control is SAFE to use — that
// stays with the model-level TX refusal and rollback (Principle VI). UI state is
// never the safety mechanism; a dimmed control that somehow receives a click
// must still be refused below the seam.
