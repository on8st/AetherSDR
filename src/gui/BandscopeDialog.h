// The wideband converter view, in its own window.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. The operator sees one slice, 48 to 384 kHz wide, and both the
// waterfall and the S-meter are post-DDC. A broadcast station 20 MHz outside
// that slice can drive the converter towards its rail while everything on the
// main display looks calm. This window shows the converter's whole first
// Nyquist zone so that condition is visible instead of inferred.
//
// TWO DESIGN DECISIONS, BOTH DELIBERATE:
//
//   * A SEPARATE WINDOW rather than a mode of the panadapter. The point is
//     seeing both at once — a mode switch hides the comparison the feature
//     exists to show — and a new window changes no existing surface.
//   * ON DEMAND rather than continuous. A continuous consumer would be a second
//     permanent load on the backend's I/O thread, and for the HL2 that thread
//     already carries EP2 pacing, EP6 ingest, WDSP and the panadapter FFT. That
//     cost has NEVER BEEN MEASURED. One frame when the window opens and one per
//     Refresh avoids the question rather than guessing the answer.
//
// IT NAMES NO RADIO FAMILY. The window asks the connected backend for
// RadioCapabilities::widebandConverterView and invokes the namespace and verb
// that record carries. Today exactly one backend answers; this window does not
// know or care which.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE: a waterfall, click-to-tune, markers, band
// annotations, or any interaction with the panadapter. Each of those is a
// separate design decision.
