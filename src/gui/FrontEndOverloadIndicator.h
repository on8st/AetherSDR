//
// A lamp and one state word, sitting beside the RF Gain slider where the
// operator already looks. The regulator's action is in the tooltip and the
// accessible description, not on the line. It draws what FrontEndOverloadPresentation.h decides and holds
// no rules of its own beyond the red latch, which needs a clock and therefore
// cannot live in a pure header.
//
// BORN HIDDEN. A family whose backend never emits frontEndOverloadChanged never
// shows this, for the same reason the Auto checkbox beside it is hidden rather
// than disabled: a control wired to nothing is the HERMES 17 failure the
// capability comments keep warning about.
