// Per-band LNA memory: which value a session comes up on, and which value the
// band memory records when the operator leaves that band.
//
// These are two separate questions and the backend previously answered only the
// first. The second is where the defect lives: a connect that pins the LNA via
// the namespaced lnaGainDb param diverges the live value from the start band's
// stored entry, and the FIRST band change then writes the live value back over
// that entry (Hl2Backend::rememberCurrentBandState). The operator's calibration
// for that band is gone, replaced by a number that was only ever meant to hold
// for one session.
//
// Symptom, and why it is worth a header: the loss is silent and it is delayed.
// Nothing is wrong at connect — the pinned value is what was asked for. The
// stored entry dies later, on an unrelated action, and the next session comes
// up on the pinned value as though the operator had chosen it. By the time a
// band sounds wrong there is nothing left on disk that says what it used to be.
//
// They live in a header, evaluated by Hl2Backend rather than copied into it, so
// the suite exercises the SAME expressions the backend runs — the reasoning
// Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h states, and the same reason it applies here: a test
// against a re-typed copy of this decision would agree with itself while the
// backend kept the bug.
//
// See Hl2Backend::connectRadio and ::applyPerBandStateFor for the surrounding
// ordering; this header is the decision only.

// from the operator acting on this band, and the band already had an entry of
// its own — so recording it would overwrite a calibration with a number nobody
// chose for this band. The stored entry is kept instead.
//
// Note what this deliberately does NOT do: it does not make the pin invisible.
// The live gain stays pinned, the radio runs at the requested value, and every
// pan is told about it. Only the persistence is refused, because persistence is
// the part that outlives the session that asked for it.

// ---- What a band change applies -------------------------------------------

// The LNA a band change should put on the register, or "nothing to do".
//
// Extracted to settle a claim rather than to fix a defect. The witnessed run
// reported "one LNA line per session across four band changes" and concluded
// the stored per-band entry is never re-applied. It cannot conclude that: the
// "HL2 LNA gain:" line is emitted by setPanRfGain, and the band-change path
// reaches applyLnaGainDb, which logs NOTHING. An absent log line is what this
// path looks like whether it fires or not.
//
// Mirrors Hl2Backend::applyPerBandStateFor exactly:
//   - a "change" to the band already current does nothing;
//   - otherwise the new band's stored entry applies, or the default if it has
//     none, clamped;
//   - and the write is skipped when the value already matches, which is a
//     no-op rather than a failure to apply.
