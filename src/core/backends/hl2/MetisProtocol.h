// HPSDR Protocol 1 ("Metis") wire primitives for the Hermes-Lite 2 backend.
//
// Direct C++ port of the live-validated tools/hl2/hpsdr.py spike (aetherd
// HL2 Phase 1a). Protocol facts (register map, EP2/EP6 framing, LNA gain
// register) are grounded clean-room in openHPSDR Protocol 1, the Hermes-Lite 2
// wiki/gateware, and the pihpsdr reference client (Principle I; see
// THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES). Where a fact is HL2-specific it has been checked
// against the Hermes-Lite 2 gateware RTL, which is the authority for what this
// hardware actually decodes.
//
// This layer is intentionally socket-free and Qt-free so it unit-tests against
// captured/synthetic frames without hardware; MetisClient owns the UDP socket
// and RX thread and calls into these functions.
//
// TRANSMIT: this layer CAN now encode a keyed frame. The old invariant here —
// "every C0 register-address byte is even, so MOX (C0 bit 0) is always 0, so
// these primitives cannot key the radio" — no longer holds, and pretending
// otherwise would be worse than losing it.
//
// What replaces it is a gate one level up: MetisClient will not set MOX unless
// transmit has been explicitly enabled, and hl2_tx_gate_test asserts that with
// the gate off NO emitted frame ever carries C0 bit 0. The encoders below are
// pure functions; encoding a keyed frame is not the same as sending one.
