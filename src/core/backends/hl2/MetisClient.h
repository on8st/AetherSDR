    // THESE COUNT; THEY DO NOT REPAIR. The truncation is still exactly what it
    // was, deliberately: giving the FIFO a floor (a pre-roll, a target depth,
    // or a held/ramped last sample instead of a step to zero) changes what
    // this client transmits, and that is a separate decision from being able
    // to see the fault at all. Counting first is what makes that decision
    // measurable rather than argued.
    //
    // The spectral cost is measured, not assumed: on EP2 captures of live
    // speech, windows containing no starvation give 78.6-78.8 dB
    // opposite-sideband suppression and windows containing one give
    // 33.7-35.2 dB. A SINGLE zeroed sample takes it from 78.99 dB to 48.97 dB.
    // Gating a one-sided analytic spectrum with a real gate is an image
    // generator, and the gate here is the zero fill.
    //
    // PROVENANCE, because those numbers will otherwise be read as on-air
    // figures and they are not. The captures are EP2 traffic off the wire, but
    // the peer was hpsdrsim on loopback rather than a radio, so the producer
    // clock is not a live sound card. What they establish is that the
    // starvation HAPPENS in ordinary speech and what it costs WITHIN one
    // capture; they do not establish the on-air magnitude. Nor is 78.7 dB the
    // modulator's own suppression -- on a steady tone the same instrument reads
    // 87.15-87.19 dB, matching Hl2TxDsp::designFilters. 78.7 is the clean-window
    // baseline for speech through this instrument, which is what makes the
    // 33.7-35.2 dB comparison meaningful.
    //
    // WHY THE RADIO'S OWN FIFO TELEMETRY CANNOT SEE THIS, which is the trap:
    // Hl2Telemetry::txFifoFillMsbs and ::txFifoRecovery report the GATEWARE's
    // DSIQ FIFO -- 16384 deep on this board, with the 0-127 reading being the
    // TOP SEVEN BITS of its fill level rather than its depth or a sample count,
    // as MetisProtocol.h says at the decode -- and that FIFO is fed by EP2
    // PACKET ARRIVALS. An
    // underflow here does not drop a packet or shorten one -- onEp2PacerTick
    // emits a full-size EP2 frame on the wall clock either way, and
    // ep2WriteTxIq zero-fills the samples that were not supplied. The radio
    // therefore receives an unbroken 48 kHz sample stream whose CONTENT is
    // partly silence, and its FIFO fill is identical in both cases. A healthy
    // gateware FIFO reading is not evidence that this did not happen.
    //
    // AND THE BLINDNESS IS SYMMETRIC, which matters just as much and is the
    // easier half to forget. These counters see the HOST end of the CLIENT's
    // queue and nothing else. They are incremented before the socket write, so
    // a datagram lost on the wire, a genuine overrun of the gateware's DSIQ
    // FIFO, or anything else that happens after this client hands the bytes to
    // the socket is invisible to THEM exactly as a host starvation is invisible
    // to the gateware rows. The two instruments are DISJOINT, not overlapping:
    // neither can stand in for the other, and a fault occurring between the
    // socket write and the FIFO is invisible to both. "The counters are clean"
    // is not evidence that the transmission was.
    //
    // Underflow is counted only on the queued-IQ path while keyed. The CW and
    // test-tone paths synthesise a whole block per packet and cannot starve,
    // and an UNKEYED frame carries silence by design rather than by fault.
    //
    // Packets and samples are both counted because they separate two different
    // faults that the sample count alone conflates: a burst of whole-packet
    // underflows at key-down is the missing pre-roll (the queue has not been
    // primed yet), while occasional PARTIAL packets mid-over are the pacer and
    // the audio device clock drifting apart. Same counter, different shapes.
    //
    // THESE DO NOT ANSWER "WAS THIS OVER CLEAN", and the shape of the error is
    // a FALSE POSITIVE rather than a miss. THE FLOOR HAS TWO HALVES, at the two
    // ends of the over, and the first published description of it named only
    // the smaller one.
    //
    //   THE TAIL, at key-up. Real audio does not end on a packet boundary, so
    //   the last packet of a perfectly healthy over is short and is counted: at
    //   the moment the count is taken, "the queue is short" and "the over is
    //   over" are indistinguishable here. ONE underflow packet, plus
    //   1..kTxSamplesPerPacket-1 samples.
    //
    //   THE PRE-ROLL, at key-down, and it is the BIGGER half. It is the same
    //   missing pre-roll the paragraph above names, read as a floor rather than
    //   as a fault: Hl2Backend::applyKeying posts setMox to this client
    //   immediately, while the first block of transmit IQ cannot arrive until
    //   the audio chain has produced one -- Hl2TxDsp works in whole
    //   Config::dspBlockSize blocks at Config::inputSampleRateHz, and nothing
    //   primes m_txIq before MOX. Every tick in between takes the empty-queue
    //   arm and counts a WHOLE packet. So a clean over OPENS with a burst of
    //   whole-packet underflows and CLOSES with the short tail, and the burst
    //   is worth an order of magnitude more silent samples than the tail is.
    //
    // Both halves are measured and pinned in hl2_tx_gate_test rather than
    // described, so that changing either is a change that announces itself.
    // Neither is a defect in this client: they are what an unprimed,
    // wall-clock-paced FIFO reads on a healthy transmission, and they are the
    // reason these counters are a session budget and not a per-over verdict.
    //
    // txUnderflowPackets is the more polluted of the two: its floor is a fixed
    // per-over cost that does not grow with the over's length, while a real
    // starvation adds kTxSamplesPerPacket per packet for as long as it lasts.
    //
    // "TOTALS" MEANS SINCE PROCESS START. Nothing resets these -- not start(),
    // not a link edge, not flushTxIq() -- so they accumulate across reconnects
    // and, if the operator switches radios without restarting, across radios.
    // That is deliberate rather than an oversight, and the log line says so in
    // those words: the question they answer is "how much substituted silence
    // has this PROCESS put on the air", and a reset on a link edge would erase
    // exactly the slow accumulation they exist to show. An operator who wants a
    // per-link figure subtracts two readings.
    //
    // Suppressing either half of the floor would need the count deferred and
