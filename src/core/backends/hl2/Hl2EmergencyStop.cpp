// Plain globals, not a class: a signal handler must not touch anything whose
// lifetime it cannot reason about, and these have static storage duration for
// the whole process.
//
// THE PAYLOAD IS IMMUTABLE ONCE PUBLISHED, and that is the synchronisation.
// arm() fills a slot NO HANDLER CAN BE LOOKING AT, then publishes it with a
// single release store; fire() acquire-loads the pointer once and reads only
// through it. That is what makes a handler firing halfway through arm() see
// either the complete previous target or the complete new one — never a
// descriptor paired with someone else's address.
//
// THAT GUARANTEE USED TO BE CLAIMED HERE AND NOT DELIVERED, which is the defect
// aethersdr/AetherSDR#4581 is about. The previous shape kept ONE mutable
// payload: arm() stored -1 into the descriptor "to stop any concurrent fire()",
// then memset the address in place, then republished. It does not stop a
// handler whose acquire-load had ALREADY returned the previous descriptor — an
// atomic store cannot reach back and change a load that has happened — and that
// handler went on to read the address while the memset was running. Signals are
// delivered to an arbitrary thread, so the handler need not be the arming one.
//
// No memory order on the disarming store closes that. An ordering constrains
// which other writes a load is guaranteed to see ALONGSIDE a value; it does not
// constrain WHICH VALUE a racing load may return. Not mutating what a handler
// may still be reading is what closes it.
//
// TWO SLOTS ARE ENOUGH. Reaching the slot a handler is reading would take two
// further arms — two reconnects — inside the few microseconds of three sendto()
// calls, in a process that is already on its way out because a terminating
// signal has been delivered.
