// SSB transmit chain for the Hermes-Lite 2: processed TX audio in, baseband IQ
// out, ready for EP2.
//
// The audio arrives already shaped — AudioEngine's TX chain has applied the test
// tone, compressor and EQ before we see it — so this stage is only modulation.
// That is deliberate: it means the TONE button, the microphone and any future
// source all reach the air through ONE path, and what the operator monitors is
// what gets transmitted.
//
// RATES. AudioEngine runs at 24 kHz; EP2 is clocked at a fixed 48 kHz
// regardless of the RX sample rate. WDSP's three-rate channel model does the
// interpolation, which is the same mechanism the RX side uses in the opposite
// direction rather than a second, hand-rolled resampler.
//
// MODULATION is chosen AT BUILD TIME by AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA (CMakeLists.txt) and
// by nothing else. There is no runtime switch and there must not be one: two
// silent transmit paths are worse than one. What the flag selects is the
// MODULATOR only — the level chain below it (mic gain, the ALC and its
// client-leveled ceiling, the hard clamp, and all three meters) is shared, is
// identical in both builds, and is not part of the choice.
//
//   AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA=1 (default) — a WDSP TXA channel at the live geometry.
//   AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA=0            — the in-tree phasing modulator, the way back.
//
// THE TWO MODULATORS HAVE OPPOSITE HANDEDNESS CONVENTIONS and this is the one
// place that is easy to get catastrophically wrong, because it is invisible
// from inside this application:
//
//   * The PHASING modulator emits the standard analytic signal and must be
//     CONJUGATED for the HPSDR wire. Omitting that transmitted every signal on
//     the wrong sideband, and it took an operator with a second receiver to
//     catch it.
//   * A TXA channel must NOT be conjugated. fir_bandpass builds
//     exp(-j*w_osc*pos), so a POSITIVE signed passband already selects the
//     negative baseband half — TXA already has the wire's handedness. Instead
//     the SIGN of the passband carries the sideband, because TXASetupBPFilters
//     handles TXA_LSB and TXA_USB with the identical CalcBandpassFilter call and
//     SetTXAMode therefore does not choose a sideband for SSB at all.
//
// Config::filterLowHz/filterHighHz stay the POSITIVE, audio-domain pair
// Hl2Backend pushes for every mode, in both builds. The TXA build applies the
// sign itself, from the mode, in applyModeAndFilter(). Do not move that into
// Hl2Backend: its table is shared with the readback and with the operator's
// stored eSSB pair, and both want magnitudes.
//
// THE TXA BUILD DEPENDS ON THE CALLER'S CADENCE and the phasing build does not.
// See the note on processAudioBlock and modulatorFaultBlocks().

    //                                the only source tagged this way — keys for
    //                                111.6 s with nobody at the microphone.
    //                                Yoking a beacon to the setting an operator
    //                                picked for their voice is a defect that
    //                                predates the ALC change; it was merely
    //                                invisible while 40 dB of makeup normalised
    //                                every source onto the target.
    //
    // THE AX.25 MODEM IS Microphone, NOT EngineGenerated, and the reason is a
    // level rather than a label: its AFSK amplitude is a compile-time constant
    // (kTxAfskAmplitude = 0.35, -9.12 dBFS) and the packet dialog carries no
    // level control, so this slider is the only thing in the product that can
    // move a packet frame. Bypassing it would pin HF packet 7.71 dB under
    // alcTargetPeak with nothing able to raise it. (RADE never reaches here at
    // all: it needs DAX audio, activateRADE() refuses any radio that cannot
    // provide it, and a Flex modulates on its own side.)
    //
    // WHY IT IS A SOURCE AND NOT THE BOOL IT REPLACED. `clientLeveled` selected
    // the ALC's ceiling: unity for client-leveled audio, alcMaxGainDb (40 dB)
    // for everything else. That asymmetry was #4796 — an ALC applied to a
    // client that sets its own level normalized that level control away above
    // the hold threshold and froze into a path-dependent gain below it. The
    // remedy was to ceiling the client path at unity, and then the ceiling
    // became unity on EVERY path, which left the bool nothing to select. What
    // it could never say is the distinction that matters once the makeup is
    // gone: it answered "did an external client set this level?", so the
    // operator's microphone and the engine's own generators shared one bucket.
    //
    // What survives from that era is the half that was never the bug and never
    // depended on the flag: the MODULATOR owns its own ceiling. Reduction still
    // applies to everything, because m_micGain reaches 100x (+40 dB,
    // Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h) and a full-scale source with the TX gain slider up
    // arrives far inside the hard clamp below — and flat-topping an SSB
    // modulator input splatters across the band. That clamp is a backstop, not
    // a level control, and must not become the only thing standing between a
    // hot source and the air.
    //
    // The ALC itself is unchanged for all three: reduction-only, unity ceiling.
    // Engine audio is protected from splatter exactly like everything else; it
    // simply is not RE-LEVELLED on its way in.
    //
    // RESIDUE: m_inBuffer carries up to dspBlockSize-1 samples between calls and
    // would be levelled with the NEW block's multiplier, so a source change
    // inside one transmission drops the carry rather than mislevelling it. See
    // the guard at the top of processAudioBlock().
    //
    // hl2_txdsp_test's #4796 cases still pass unchanged, which is the evidence
    // that none of this moved the TCI/DAX path.
    //
    // ── THE TXA BUILD IS NOT RATE-FREE, and the phasing build is ──────────
    //
    // The phasing modulator is a convolution: N audio samples in gives exactly
    // 2N IQ samples out, whenever they are handed over and however fast.
    //
    // A TXA channel is not. It is opened with blockForOutput = false -- the
    // setting Hl2RxDsp uses and the setting every figure on #5678 was measured
    // at -- so WdspChannel::processIq RETURNS Underrun rather than waiting when
    // the channel's output side is not ready yet. A caller that feeds faster
    // than real time starves it: measured at this geometry, 240-255 of 256
    // blocks underrun unpaced, against 0 of 64 at the live 21.33 ms block
    // period and 0 at 5 ms. An underrun is not a dropped block either --
    // fexchange2 advances r2_outidx on the miss without consuming, so the
    // stream thereafter runs one whole DSP buffer AHEAD, permanently.
    //
    // The live caller is paced: AudioEngine's TX poll hands this stage audio as
    // the sound card produces it. Every OTHER caller -- a test, a bench
    // harness, an offline render -- has to pace itself or it is measuring
    // starvation. It will not be told quietly: a starved block is counted in
    // modulatorFaultBlocks() and logged.
    //
