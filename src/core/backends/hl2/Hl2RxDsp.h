    // as a DC pedestal. Nothing upstream removes it:
    //
    //   * `levelfade` (ON by default, RXA.c) computes
    //     `audio += dc_insert - dc` from an 8 Hz-corner and a 0.11 Hz-corner
    //     average. That cancels FADING and deliberately holds the pedestal at
    //     the long-term carrier level; it is not a DC blocker.
    //   * The AM/SAM passband is symmetric about the carrier ({-4000, +4000}
    //     in Hl2Backend::defaultPassbandForMode) because both detectors need
    //     it that way, which puts 0 Hz mid-band.
    //
    // Left in, the pedestal eats output headroom and skews every
    // zero-referenced consumer downstream — the WAVE applet draws `peak` and
    // `rms`, both magnitudes, mirrored about a hard centreline, so a DC-shifted
    // trace renders as a second inverted phantom copy of itself in the lower
    // half.
    //
    // SCOPE: this runs on WdspChannel's OUTPUT, downstream of the whole RXA
    // chain, so it fixes the audio we deliver but NOT what WDSP itself saw.
    // wcpAGC sits after amd INSIDE RXA and still rides the pedestal; correcting
    // that would need DC removal between the two, which WDSP exposes no hook
    // for. Turning `levelfade` off does not help either — it only stops the
    // fade correction, leaving sqrt(I^2+Q^2) just as non-negative.
    //
    // WHY HERE AND NOT IN WdspChannel: the root cause is amd's envelope
    // detector, which belongs to WDSP, so a blocker on WdspChannel's own RX
    // output would fix it once for every future consumer instead of per caller.
    // Hl2RxDsp is the only WDSP RECEIVE consumer in the tree today — Hl2TxDsp is
    // the one other user and is transmit-only — so per-caller costs nothing yet.
