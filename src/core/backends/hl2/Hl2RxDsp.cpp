    // channel destroyed while WDSP still thinks it is running burns WDSP's full
    // 100 ms timeout, per channel, on whichever thread is doing the tearing
    // down. Stopping here makes close()'s SetChannelState a no-op and the wait
    // is skipped entirely. docs/HERMES.md §13 item 9b.
    //
    // WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY: a clean down-slew. Every path that destroys an
    // Hl2RxDsp has already withdrawn it from the sample fan-out (or the wire
    // was never started), so no block reaches processIq() after this line and
    // WDSP's mute ramp never actually runs. The saving is the skipped wait, not
    // a smoother exit. The one place a stop CAN be taken with samples still
    // flowing is the T/R mute, which is item 9a and is a bench decision.
    //
    // "NO BLOCK REACHES processIq() AFTER THIS LINE" IS A CORRECTNESS
    // PRECONDITION, NOT A PERFORMANCE DETAIL, and it is stated here rather than
    // enforced. A stop followed by clocking leaves WDSP's flushChannel thread
    // runnable, and before AetherSDR patch 9 nothing in CloseChannel waited for
    // it: destroy_main() freed the RXA chain while that thread was inside
    // flush_rxa() on it. MEASURED as a use-after-free, 30 of 30 trials, on the
    // exact shape stop-then-clock-then-destroy; stop-then-destroy with nothing
    // clocked between was clean. Found by ten9876 in review of #5628.
    //
    // Patch 9 makes that barrier explicit in the vendored tree, so this
    // destructor is no longer the only thing standing between the two. The
    // precondition is still worth stating: it is what makes the ramp's absence
    // here intentional rather than a silent loss, and item 9a is the change that
    // will make a clocked stop routine.
    //
    // CHECKED, not discarded. setRunning() goes through beginControlOperation(),
    // which REFUSES rather than waits when a processIq() callback is in flight.
    // That cannot happen here today — Hl2Backend destroys these through
    // deleteLater() posted to the I/O thread, which is the thread that drives
