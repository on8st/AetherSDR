// Phasing SSB modulator: a windowed-sinc bandpass and a matching Hilbert
// transformer, sharing one delay line.
//
// WHY NOT WDSP HERE, stated carefully because the obvious reading is wrong:
// WDSP's transmit path WORKS. wdsp_channel_test drives a TXA channel and gets
// IQ out of it, so "WDSP TX is broken" is not the claim.
//
// The claim is narrower. Driven from this backend's configuration, a TXA channel
// returned Underrun on most blocks and zeros on the rest, and closing that gap
// means working out which of a long, largely undocumented initialisation
// sequence it was missing — bandpass run, filter length, phase mode, panel,
// leveler, ALC, CFIR, each with defaults that are not obviously safe. Two
// speculative attempts at that sequence made things worse; one of them broke
// wdsp_channel_test outright, which is how the "WDSP is at fault" reading got
// disproved.
//
// The deciding factor is that the failure mode is SILENT. A transmit chain that
// is subtly misconfigured emits nothing, or emits something wrong, on the air,
// and neither announces itself. A phasing modulator is fifty lines, holds no
// hidden state, and its correctness is a number this file's test measures
// directly: opposite-sideband suppression in dB. Choosing the thing that can be
// measured over the thing that is merely canonical is the right trade for a
// path that keys a transmitter.
//
// Revisiting WDSP TXA later is entirely reasonable — with wdsp_channel_test's
// working configuration as the starting point rather than a guess.

    // WHAT THIS STAGE STOPPED BEING. It used to carry up to 40 dB of upward
    // makeup on the mic path, with an absolute hold threshold (-45 dBFS) below
    // which it stopped lifting. Both halves are gone, and the second is why
    // the first could not simply be turned down to 0 dB.
    //
    // The makeup half is gone because a level-dependent makeup stage cannot
    // tell a voice from a room. Measured on this radio: 20.5 dB of
    // speech-to-floor separation went in and 0.33 dB came out, because the
    // hold threshold sat below the room noise, so between words the loop went
    // on lifting until the fan and the mic hiss reached the same target peak
    // as the speech. The 20-30 dB gap between a microphone and full modulation
    // is real and still has to be closed; the operator's mic gain closes it
    // now, which is why Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h reaches +40 dB rather than +20.
    // WDSP draws the same line: create_txa() in
    // third_party/wdsp/upstream/TXA.c builds its `alc` with run=1 and
    // max_gain=1.0 and its `leveler` with run=0 and max_gain=1.778 (+5 dB).
    //
    // THE HOLD HAD TO GO WITH IT, not merely lose its `!clientLeveled` term.
    // Under a unity ceiling a quiet block wants target = 1.0. If an earlier
    // loud block left the gain below unity then target > m_alcGain, `reducing`
    // is false, the block is under the threshold, and the move back to unity is
    // suppressed — the transmission strands at whatever reduction its loudest
    // block called for. That is #4796's own defect class mirrored onto the mic
    // path: exactly the failure the `!clientLeveled` term was added to keep off
    // the client path, handed to the mic path instead. A hold is only coherent
    // when there is makeup gain to hold back.
    //
    // What remains is the half that was never the bug. m_micGain now reaches
    // 100x (+40 dB, Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h) and is applied BEFORE this block, so a
    // full-scale source with the TX gain slider up arrives far inside the hard
    // clamp below — and flat-topping an SSB modulator input is a splatter
    // generator, the one failure mode here that harms other operators rather
    // than the operator who caused it. The clamp is a backstop, not a level
    // control; it must not become the only thing standing between a hot source
    // and the band.

    // Below alcTargetPeak the ceiling binds, the gain sits at exactly 1.0, and
    // output is proportional to input over the whole reported range — the
    // property hl2_txdsp_test now asserts directly, as 20 dB in arriving as
    // 20 dB out. Above the target the loop reduces on its 5 ms attack, so the
    // response degrades to smooth limiting instead of clipping.
