// ── WHICH MODULATOR, AND WHY IT IS A BUILD FLAG ─────────────────────────────
//
// AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA selects one of the two implementations below AT COMPILE
// TIME. The other one is not in the binary. That is the point, and it is the
// condition #5678 was approved on: a compile flag gives a way back without
// giving an operator a way to be on the wrong one, because two silent transmit
// paths are worse than one.
//
// WHAT THE PHASING MODULATOR WAS FOR, stated fairly, because it was right at
// the time. WDSP's transmit path always WORKED -- wdsp_channel_test drove a TXA
// channel and got IQ out of it -- so "WDSP TX is broken" was never the claim.
// The claim was narrower: driven from THIS backend's configuration a TXA
// channel returned Underrun on most blocks and zeros on the rest, and the
// failure mode was SILENT. Fifty lines of arithmetic whose correctness is a
// number a test can print beat a canonical chain that can fail without saying
// so. Two speculative attempts at the missing initialisation sequence made
// things worse. Choosing the measurable thing was the right trade.
//
// WHAT CHANGED IS THAT BOTH HALVES OF THAT FAILURE ARE NOW EXPLAINED, and
// neither was a missing call:
//
//   * The UNDERRUNS were caller CADENCE, not configuration. Unpaced, 240-255
//     of 256 blocks underrun; at 5 ms and at the live 21.33 ms block period,
//     64 of 64 are Ok including the first. See processAudioBlock's note.
//   * The ZEROS were the priming stretch -- create_slews' ndelup + ntup = 840
//     input samples of mute ramp, plus the rest of the fill, bounded at about
//     48.7 ms -- sampled through a starved reader that walked it one block at a
//     time over hundreds of calls, which is what made a bounded transient look
//     permanent. Audio placed in Q is a separate, real and permanently silent
//     fault (xpanel's inselect = 2), and it is NOT what the note recorded,
//     because it underruns nothing.
//
// The configuration it actually needs is TWO CALLS on top of create_txa's
// defaults -- SetTXAMode and SetTXABandpassFreqs -- which applyModeAndFilter()
// makes and which WdspChannel already wraps.
//
// AND WHAT THE MIGRATION IS WORTH, narrowly, because the wide claim is wrong.
// Measured on the same instrument, at the live geometry, in the same units:
//
//     tone    mode    phasing modulator      TXA
//     150 Hz  DIGU          22.06 dB      >= 180.6 dB
//       1 kHz  USB          87.15 dB      >= 297.2 dB
//
// The 1 kHz column is worth NOTHING. MetisProtocol.cpp's ep2WriteTxIq packs I
// and Q as signed 16-bit, so EP2 quantises the transmit stream at roughly 96 dB
// before a sample reaches the radio: the incumbent's 87 dB is already at the
// wire's own floor and TXA's advantage there is below the wire and unusable.
//
// THE ENTIRE RETURN IS THE LOW EDGE -- 22 dB against >= 180 dB at 150 Hz, on
// the {150, 3000} passband, in DIGU and DIGL. That is the modes WSJT-X
// transmits in and nothing else. Seventy decibels the wire could carry and 255
// taps do not fill.
//
// Every TXA figure above is a LOWER BOUND, not a value: the image bin sits at
// the measuring instrument's own numerical floor, established by a halving
// probe rather than assumed. And every one of them was read off a unit test's
// emitted IQ. No radio was keyed for any of it.

    // makeup on the mic path, with an absolute hold threshold (-45 dBFS) below
    // which it stopped lifting. Both halves are gone, and the second is why
    // the first could not simply be turned down to 0 dB.
    //
    // The makeup half is gone because a level-dependent makeup stage cannot
    // tell a voice from a room. Measured on this radio: 20.5 dB of
    // speech-to-floor separation went in and 0.33 dB came out, because the
    // hold threshold sat below the room noise, so between words the loop went
    // on lifting until the fan and the mic hiss reached the same target peak
    // as the speech. The 20-30 dB gap between a microphone and full modulation
    // is real and still has to be closed; the operator's mic gain closes it
    // now, which is why Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h reaches +40 dB rather than +20.
    // WDSP draws the same line: create_txa() in
    // third_party/wdsp/upstream/TXA.c builds its `alc` with run=1 and
    // max_gain=1.0 and its `leveler` with run=0 and max_gain=1.778 (+5 dB).
    //
    // THE HOLD HAD TO GO WITH IT, not merely lose its `!clientLeveled` term.
    // Under a unity ceiling a quiet block wants target = 1.0. If an earlier
    // loud block left the gain below unity then target > m_alcGain, `reducing`
    // is false, the block is under the threshold, and the move back to unity is
    // suppressed — the transmission strands at whatever reduction its loudest
    // block called for. That is #4796's own defect class mirrored onto the mic
    // path: exactly the failure the `!clientLeveled` term was added to keep off
    // the client path, handed to the mic path instead. A hold is only coherent
    // when there is makeup gain to hold back.
    //
    // What remains is the half that was never the bug. m_micGain now reaches
    // 100x (+40 dB, Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h) and is applied BEFORE this block, so a
    // full-scale source with the TX gain slider up arrives far inside the hard
    // clamp below — and flat-topping an SSB modulator input is a splatter
    // generator, the one failure mode here that harms other operators rather
    // than the operator who caused it. The clamp is a backstop, not a level
    // control; it must not become the only thing standing between a hot source
    // and the band.
    //
    // Below alcTargetPeak the ceiling binds, the gain sits at exactly 1.0, and
    // output is proportional to input over the whole reported range — the

    // 20 dB out. Above the target the loop takes the reduction IMMEDIATELY —

    // this sentence used to name was deleted in 5607b565 (#5646) rather than
    // shortened.
