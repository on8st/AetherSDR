// Owns the ANAN-G2 UDP wire (openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol 2): session setup
// (General + DDC-Specific + High Priority with run=1), the keepalive that
// keeps the radio in RUN state, and DDC0 IQ ingest into normalized blocks.
// Below the seam; the future AnanBackend owns one P2Client plus an AnanRxDsp.
//
// Lives on AnanBackend's dedicated I/O thread, not the GUI thread -- the
// same shape MetisClient uses for the Hermes-Lite 2, and for the same
// reason: this class is what keeps the radio's own watchdog fed, so it must
// not be at the mercy of a GUI stall.
//
// RX-ONLY: there is no PTT parameter anywhere in this class, because there
// is none in P2Protocol::buildHighPriority() -- the capability to key does
// not exist yet, not merely a guard that could be bypassed. TX is RFC §2.11
// Phase 3, a separate future addition.
//
// Does NOT redo discovery to IDENTIFY the radio -- by the time start() is
// called, a caller has already resolved a host to connect to via
// AnanDiscovery's broadcast sweep or a manual probe, the same division of
// responsibility MetisClient::start() uses.
//
// It DOES send its own Discovery packet as the first thing start() does,
// for an entirely different, ANAN-specific reason that has no Protocol-1
// analogue: Phase 1a measured every radio->PC stream (DDC0 IQ included)
// arriving at "the Source Port of the Host that initiated the Discovery
// Packet" (spec p.43, p.51, p.54), literally -- not at whatever port later
// sent the General/DDC-Specific/High-Priority session-setup packets. A
// caller's manual-connect probe (ConnectionPanel::probeAnan()) already sent
// one, but from ITS OWN throwaway socket, which is closed by the time this
// object opens a new one -- so without repeating the Discovery send here,
// on THIS socket, the radio has no reason to route DDC0 IQ anywhere this
// object is listening. Sending it is not WAITED for -- session setup
// proceeds immediately after -- but a reply that does arrive on this same
// socket (see discoveryInfoReceived()) is opportunistically parsed for the
// gateware version / DDC count / board id, since nothing else in this
// class's own session ever learns those otherwise.
