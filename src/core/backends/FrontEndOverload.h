// WHAT THE RECEIVE FRONT END IS DOING, for an operator to look at.
//
// RFC #5535 approved an automatic RF-gain loop on the condition that it is
// VISIBLE. The reasoning in that ruling is the whole justification for this
// header, so it is worth repeating where the code is: the HL2's usable LNA range
// is about 18 dB, the day-to-night signal swing is of the same order, and the
// transition from clean to clipped is only 3-5 dB wide. A regulator working in
// that little room will sometimes be wrong. Wrong AND INVISIBLE is a radio that
// behaves strangely; wrong and visible is an event the operator can see and act
// on.
//
// TWO THINGS HAVE TO BE VISIBLE, NOT ONE. The clipping is the obvious half. The
// other is the REGULATOR'S OWN ACTION -- how far it has pulled the gain below
// what the operator set -- because without it "my noise floor moved and I
// touched nothing" comes back through the side door, which is the complaint
// #5625 exists to prevent.
//
// ALREADY CLASSIFIED WHEN IT GETS HERE. This struct carries a LEVEL, not a rate
// and not a threshold. Deciding when a converter is clipping "occasionally"
// rather than "most of the time" depends on what the flag means on a particular
// front end -- on the HL2 it is a three-event threshold sampled at 10 Hz, not a
// rate -- and that judgement belongs in the family backend beside the register
// it reads. Hl2AutoGainPolicy.h already makes it; this seam carries the answer
// rather than the evidence, for the same reason IAutoRfGainControl carries the
// switch rather than the levels.
//
// NO FAMILY NAME APPEARS HERE, and no wire concept. A family that cannot observe
// its converter never emits this and its indicator never appears.
