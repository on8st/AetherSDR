"""Radio feature register — the derivable cells are GENERATED and DIFFED.

WHY THIS EXISTS. docs/architecture/radio-feature-matrix.md answers the one
question a support matrix normally gets wrong: not "did the backend declare
it" and not "is there a control on screen", but "where does the click END".
A control that does nothing looks exactly like a control that works, so the
document is only worth having if it cannot quietly stop being true.

WHY NOT A TOUCH-COUNTER, WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS DESIGN. The tempting check is
"if you edit a capability field you must also edit the matrix". That enforces
A change, not THE RIGHT change. This project already owns one gate with that
shape — tools/audit_colours.py counts call sites — and the observed behaviour
is that contributors (human and agent) reason about satisfying the counter
rather than about the intent. A counter can be paid off with a comment.

So this checker GENERATES the derivable cells from the source and DIFFS them
against the committed record. A token edit cannot satisfy a diff: to change a
cell you have to change what the code does, or admit the cell was wrong.

WHAT IS DERIVABLE, AND IT IS EXACTLY FOUR QUESTIONS.

  1. Is a capability declared, and to what?   — backend capabilities() bodies
     against the defaults in RadioCapabilities.h. Three answers matter, not
     two: explicitly false, explicitly true, and NEVER ASSIGNED — the third is
     the permissive-default trap that produces a phantom control.
  2. Is the seam virtual overridden?          — the backend's class body.
  3. Is the base body a Q_UNUSED no-op?       — IRadioBackend.h.
  4. Is the control gated above the seam?     — a capability read in src/gui or
     src/models (the GUI gate), or in RadioModel (the model gate, which drops
     the intent one layer up where no backend audit can see it).

Those four decide W, D, P and H. Everything else this checker declines to
decide and emits U, which is a legitimate committed value.

THE STATES, which are ON8ST's vocabulary and not this tool's:

  W  works / reachable   — the control reaches the backend and the backend acts
  D  dead                — the control exists but the path terminates
  P  phantom             — reports success without the radio moving; reads back
                           cached state. TWO GROUNDS, and they are different
                           repairs: an inherited permissive default the backend
                           never asked for (one assignment), or a control the
                           backend DID ask for whose stored value nothing ever
                           reads (real work). A backend that asked and simply
                           did not implement is D, not P — see gate_state()
  R  refuses visibly     — the user is told no
  H  hidden              — the GUI gates the control away on a capability
  U  unverified          — the generator could not decide
  V  VERIFIED ON REAL HARDWARE — hand-added, never generated, must cite a run

V IS NEVER GENERATED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. No static read can prove a radio
obeyed; reachability is necessary and not sufficient. So the checker asserts
only two things about a V cell: that it carries a run citation, and that the
generator independently derives W for it. The second is the sharper half — a V
sitting on a cell the source says is dead is either an over-claimed V or a
broken generator, and both need a human.

U IS AN ANSWER, NOT A FAILURE — but it is not an escape hatch either. U is
accepted only where the GENERATOR emitted U. Committing U over a cell the
generator decided is a diff and fails, exactly like any other disagreement.

WHAT THIS CHECKER CANNOT SEE, stated plainly because a green run must not be
read as more than it is:

  * WHETHER THE RADIO OBEYED. W means the call reaches an implementation. The
    bench answers the rest, and only a V cell claims it.
  * A CONTROL THAT NEVER REACHES ITS SIGNAL. The widget-to-model wiring is Qt
    lambdas in constructor bodies and does not yield to a parser. The `control`
    field of each record names the widget; keeping it true is a human job.
  * WIRE TEXT THAT BYPASSES THE SEAM. RadioModel::sendCommand carries SmartSDR
    text that only a Flex ever receives, from 100+ call sites. A record may
    declare an `alt_path` for a backend; the checker verifies the named file
    contains both the named symbol and the literal wire token, which is weaker
    evidence than an override and is marked as such in the document.
    A broken alt_path is TWO different facts and the checker splits them —
    ROTTED fails, RETIRED is reported as progress. See alt_path_state(), which
    carries the whole argument; without the split, every successful seam
    migration raises an error and the error stops being read.
  * WHETHER A MODEL GATE REFUSES VISIBLY OR DROPS SILENTLY. The `visible` flag
    on a model_gate is AUTHORED. The checker verifies the gate exists; it
    cannot read a tr() string and know the operator saw it.
  * AN OVERRIDE THAT REACHES THE WIRE BUT WRITES THE WRONG REGISTER. The base
    IRadioBackend::setXitOffset is an alias into setRitOffset; a backend that
    overrides the target and not the alias is reachable and wrong. The checker
    emits U for an alias base rather than pretending either way.

ANTI-VACUITY. Every parser here fails toward "found nothing", and "found
nothing" would make every cell derive the same way and the diff pass on a
matrix that had stopped meaning anything. The floors below are not tuning
knobs: they separate "the tree moved" from "the parser fell over", and they
return 1 regardless of --strict because a silent disarm is the failure this
whole file exists to prevent.

Usage:
    python tools/check_radio_feature_matrix.py            # report
    python tools/check_radio_feature_matrix.py --strict   # exit 1 on a diff
    python tools/check_radio_feature_matrix.py --print    # derived cells only

stdlib only; no third-party dependencies.

            ASSIGNED THE FIELD: `effective()` returns DEFAULT_* only when the
            capabilities() body carries no assignment at all. An explicit
            assignment — to any value, permissive or not — yields TRUE or
            DYNAMIC, never DEFAULT_TRUE, so it can never produce a P.

        Stated as the question a contributor should ask: DID THIS BACKEND ASK
        FOR THIS CONTROL? If it asked and did not implement it, that is a bug
        in that backend and the cell is D. If it never mentioned the field and
        a permissive default offered the control on its behalf, that is a gap
        in the default and the cell is P — repairable with one assignment.

        The live pair makes the distinction concrete and they are one row apart.
        FmTonePresentation defaults to `Hidden` and `Legacy` is what turns the
        tone controls ON; HL2 assigns `Legacy` EXPLICITLY, so it asked, and its
        unimplemented tone verbs are D. hasFmRepeaterOffset defaults to `true`
        and HL2 never mentions it, so it never asked, and the repeater rows are
        P. Reading the ENUM VALUE as the discriminator would get both right here
        by luck and be wrong on the next backend that writes a permissive value
        down on purpose.

    #            now the STRONGER kind — a compiler-checked override instead of
    #            a text match. Reported as progress; never fails.
    #
    # Four conditions, each ruling out one way the cheerful reading could be
    # wrong. All four must hold, or it is rot:
    #
    #   (a) THE TOKEN IS GONE FROM THE DECLARED FILE. A file that still emits
    #       the wire token still has the bypass; the record merely names the
    #       wrong symbol for it. That is a rename nobody recorded — rot.
    #   (b) THE BACKEND OVERRIDES THE ROW'S SEAM VERB, with a body that is not
    #       a Q_UNUSED no-op. This is "the primary evidence is intact", and it
    #       is a compiler-checked fact rather than another text match. It also
    #       means derive() never consulted this record — it returned at the
    #       override rung — which is what makes the retirement cell-neutral.
    #   (c) THE CELL STILL DERIVES W. The alt path existed to argue
    #       reachability. If the control stopped being reachable, nothing was
    #       retired; something was lost.
    #   (d) THE WIRE TOKEN IS STILL EMITTED FROM THE BACKEND'S OWN SOURCE.
    #       The positive half, and the one that catches a "migration" that
    #       moved the call and forgot to send anything: the bypass has to have
    #       been ABSORBED below the seam, not merely deleted.
    #
    # NO RECURSION, though (c) calls derive(): derive() consults an alt_path
    # only at the rung it reaches when the verb is NOT overridden, and (b)
    # has already returned ROTTED in that case.
    #
    # ONE CASE THIS CANNOT SEPARATE, said out loud rather than glossed. Where
    # the backend ALREADY overrode the verb and ALREADY carried the same wire
    # token below the seam — three records today: rx/filter, rx/agc-threshold
    # and rx/pan-center on Flex — mangling the above-seam literal yields a tree
    # indistinguishable from the migration, because it IS the same tree in
    # every respect this register scores: the cell is still true and the bypass
    # no longer carries that text. A perturbation aimed at this check therefore
    # has to be aimed at a LOAD-BEARING record — 37 of the 40 — where breaking
    # it really does change where the click ends.

    # DOES ANYTHING REFUSE WHEN THE DECLARATION IS ABSENT?
    #
    #   In the GUI, no. The defaults are permissive (hasFmRepeaterOffset = true),
    #   the gates are hand-written and optional, and a control whose capability
    #   nobody declared is simply live. So a GUI cell must be derived from
    #   REACHABILITY — the override table — and a declaration is only a
    #   cross-check.
    #
    #   In aetherd, yes, and it is written into the target. ModelReceiveControlTarget
    #   opens every admission with `caps.<record> && known(authority)` and returns
    #   the typed error `capability.unavailable`; ModelSliceFrequencyTarget's
    #   validCoverage() does the same with a range. There the DECLARATION IS THE
    #   CONTRACT, and reading it is not a shortcut past the truth.
    #
    # The trap this avoids is a PHANTOM W: deriving the headless cell from the
    # backend override would report "works" for every verb the daemon never
    # exposes, because the override exists and nothing headless calls it. So a
    # feature with no aetherd method gets NO headless cell at all — it is listed
    # under "not on this surface" instead of being scored — and a feature whose
    # record is absent gets R, because the client is told no in a typed error.
    #
    # And the ranges are checked, not just the authority. Flex declares
    # sliceFrequencyControl = {Authority::Radio, 0, 0}: the authority is known
    # and validCoverage() still rejects it on minimumHz <= 0. A derivation that
