// ── Impulse noise blanker (ANB, nob.c) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOT part of the RXA chain, and that is a property of WDSP rather than a
// choice made here: RXA.c never instantiates an ANB, so unlike the AGC or the
// notches there is no SetRXAANB* to call. The blanker is a stage the HOST runs
// on raw IQ before handing it to the channel — which is also the only place it
// CAN run, because blanking an impulse has to happen before any filter smears
// it across time. Both reference clients do exactly this (pihpsdr
// receiver.c full_rx_buffer, Thetis cmaster.c).
//
// IDENTIFIED BY AN `id`, from a table of 32 in nob.c that is INDEPENDENT of
// WDSP's channel table. This host deliberately passes the WdspChannel's own
// channel id as the blanker id: both tables are 32 entries, WdspChannel already
// owns the allocation and release of that number, and reusing it means one
// lifetime instead of two that can drift apart. Anything else linking against
// this facade must do the same, or claim ids from a separate allocator.
//
// BUFFER FORMAT is INTERLEAVED DOUBLE — I,Q,I,Q — `buffsize` complex samples
// long, and the same pointer may be passed as both in and out for in-place
// operation. This is fexchange0's format, not fexchange2's separate float
// planes, so a host on fexchange2 has to interleave into a staging buffer.
//
// HANDEDNESS DOES NOT MATTER. xanb() looks only at sqrt(I*I + Q*Q), so a
// conjugated wire (the HPSDR convention — see Hl2RxDsp::processIqBlock) blanks
// identically to an unconjugated one. This is the one IQ stage on this path
// with no sign trap in it.
//
// PARAMETERS. `threshold` is the trigger: a sample blanks when its magnitude
// exceeds threshold times the running average magnitude, so SMALLER is MORE
// aggressive. tau/hangtime/advtime are the transition, hold-off and look-ahead
// times in seconds; backtau is the time constant of that running average.
// pihpsdr's fixed set is (0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.05, 20).
//
// ARMING DELAY, which is not obvious and is worth designing around: flush
// (and creation) sets the running average to 1.0 — full scale — so immediately
// afterwards nothing exceeds threshold * avg and the blanker does nothing until
// the average has decayed to the real signal level. At backtau = 0.05 s that is
// a few hundred milliseconds. The failure direction is the safe one (no
// blanking rather than blanking everything), but a host that flushes on every
// transmit-to-receive edge gets an unarmed blanker for the first moment of
// every receive period.
//
// Every Set* below is control-path work: they take the stage's lock. NONE of
// them allocate — create_anb sizes the delay line once at
// (MAX_TAU + MAX_ADVTIME) * MAX_SAMPLERATE, independent of both buffsize and
// samplerate, so SetEXTANBBuffsize only stores the count and
// SetEXTANBSamplerate only re-derives the sample counts through initBlanker().
//
// xanbEXT allocates nothing and is safe on the real-time path. flush_anbEXT
// allocates nothing either, but it is CHEAP rather than FREE: it takes the same
// lock as the setters and initBlanker() memsets the whole delay line (~98 KB)
// and rebuilds the transition table. Calling it from the audio callback is
// permissible; calling it on every block, or on every transmit-to-receive edge,
// is not what it is for — see the ARMING DELAY note above.

// ── Manual notch filters (the notched-bandpass stage, nbp0) ────────────────
//
// This is the host-side equivalent of a Flex TNF, and on a direct-sampling
// radio it is the ONLY notch there is: the HL2 protocol carries no DSP at all
// (HL2 oracle addendum 3 §B4), so a notch either happens here or not at all.
//
// COORDINATE SPACE — the one thing to get right. Notch centres are ABSOLUTE
// frequencies in the same units the host feeds RXANBPSetTuneFrequency(); WDSP
// subtracts (tunefreq + shift) internally when it rebuilds the filter mask
// (nbp.c calc_nbp_lightweight). Feed it RF Hz and a notch stays glued to the
// interferer as the operator tunes — which is what makes it a *tracking*
// notch rather than an audio-frequency one. Feed it baseband offsets and it
// will appear to work until the moment someone tunes.
//
// A host that calls SetRXAShiftFreq() MUST also call RXANBPSetShiftFrequency()
// with the matching value; nothing inside WDSP connects the two, so the notch
// silently drifts off the signal by the shift amount otherwise.
//
// The notch handle is a POSITIONAL INDEX into a dense array, not a stable id.
// Add inserts at `notch` and shifts everything above it up; Delete closes the
// gap and shifts everything above it down. A caller holding its own stable ids
// must remap after every delete or it will edit the wrong notch.
//
// Width has a floor that depends on the filter length, and it is enforced
// SILENTLY: the nbp stage is created with autoincr=1 (RXA.c), so a notch
// narrower than min_notch_width() is widened rather than refused. That floor is
// 1600 / (nc / 256) * (rate / 48000) Hz for the default window type — 200 Hz at
// nc=2048, 50 Hz at nc=8192. Ask for 50 Hz at 2048 taps and WDSP gives you 200
// without saying so, which is the difference between notching one carrier and
// notching the carrier plus everything around it.

//
// state 0 turns it OFF. Nothing else in WDSP ever writes alc.p->run -- not
// SetTXAMode, not SetTXABandpassFreqs, not TXASetupBPFilters -- so one call
// after OpenChannel would hold for the channel's lifetime.
//
// DECLARED AND DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED. This host leaves the ALC RUNNING, and
// the declaration is here so the next person to propose turning it off finds
// the measurement that says not to before they write the call.
//
// The case for turning it off looks strong and every part of it is true. The
// stage runs on create_txa's defaults, configured by nothing. It cannot add
// gain -- max_gain = var_gain = 1.0 makes loadWcpAGC give min_volts =
// out_target and slope_constant = 0, so the multiplier is exactly
// out_target/volts capped at 1.0. It is unmetered: this host publishes no TXA
// meter, so nothing shows it acting. And xtxa() runs it AFTER bp0, bp1 and bp2
// and before the modulators, so anything it creates escapes every filter.
//
// WHAT IS BEHIND IT IS A CLIPPER, AND THAT SETTLES IT. The last stage before
// the radio is MetisProtocol.cpp's ep2WriteTxIq, which clamps I and Q
// INDEPENDENTLY to +/-1.0 -- a harder nonlinearity than the ALC, after
// everything, and one that moves phase as well as amplitude. While the ALC
// runs, the envelope leaving TXA cannot exceed out_target = 0.997424 and that
// clipper never engages. With it off, bp0's ringing on the audio Hl2TxDsp has
// already clamped at +/-1.0 takes the envelope to about 1.27 (measured: the
// TXA_ALC_GAIN meter reads 2.08 dB there) and the wire clipper takes the rest.
//
// MEASURED, in wdsp_channel_test's runTransmitAlcImdTest, two-tone IMD3 in dBc
// against one tone, USB 300..2700, driven as Hl2TxDsp drives it:
//
//                              at the TXA output      past the wire clamp
//   1205 Hz spacing, ALC on        -87.5                   -89.4
//   1205 Hz spacing, ALC off       -87.7                   -27.8
//     50 Hz spacing, ALC on        -21.5                   -21.5
//     50 Hz spacing, ALC off       -23.0                   -20.6
//
// Turning the ALC off is 61.7 dB WORSE on the band at 1205 Hz spacing. The
// column that made it look harmless is the one that stops at the TXA output,
// which is not where the transmitter ends.
//
// AND THE MECHANISM IT WAS BLAMED FOR IS NOT ITS MECHANISM. The claim was that
// the 1 ms tau_attack tracks the 0.83 ms envelope of a two-tone spaced
// ~1205 Hz. It does not: the loop compares against ring_max, a running maximum
// over attack_buffsize = ceil(rate * n_tau * tau_attack) = 288 samples = a 6 ms
// LOOK-AHEAD PEAK WINDOW, which spans about seven of those envelope periods.
// Measured at 702 + 1907 Hz, LSB, at -20, -10 and -6 dBFS per tone, the gain
// ripples by 0.000 dB and the IMD3 difference is below the arithmetic floor.
// It modulates only below about 170 Hz -- where speech envelopes are -- and
// even there, at 50 Hz spacing, it costs 1.5 dB against a clipper already
// producing -23 dBc.
//
// It DOES cost 6 ms of transmit group delay (xwcpagc reads ring[out_index]
// while writing ring[in_index] with in_index = attack_buffsize + out_index),
// which docs/hl2-txa-configuration-diff.md's +21.6 ms derivation never counted.
// That is a real cost and it is not worth 61.7 dB.

// no alc stage at all.

// ── Neural Noise Reduction (NNR, nnr.c — new in WDSP 2.10) ────────────────
//
// A HOST-SIDE STAGE, like the impulse blanker above and unlike everything
// else here. create_nnr()/xnnr()/destroy_nnr() touch neither ch[] nor rxa[],
// so the block runs without a channel — which is what lets AetherSDR run it
// in AudioEngine beside DFNR and RN2 rather than inside the RXA chain, and
// therefore on every backend rather than only the ones that demodulate here
// (RFC #5684 §3.4). RXA builds its own NNR per channel regardless; that one
// is left at run=0 and is not this.
//
// A SPEECH MODEL, trained on HF noise with SSB-processed speech. Measured on
// a 700 Hz carrier it attenuates 28 dB — it classifies an unmodulated tone as
// noise and deletes it. Voice modes only; CW, the digital modes and anything
// on the data path must never reach it.
//
// SAMPLE RATE MUST BE AN INTEGER MULTIPLE OF 16000. calc_nnr() sets run = 0
// and logs otherwise, so a 44.1 kHz path would silently produce no noise
// reduction rather than an error. 48000 gives decim 3.
//
// BUFFER FORMAT is INTERLEAVED DOUBLE — I,Q,I,Q — `size` complex samples,
// same as the blanker. Only I is read. On output, Q is zeroed when cmode is
// 1 and mirrors I when it is 0. The same pointer may not be passed as both
// in and out: the block delays its output through an internal FIFO.
//
// LATENCY is 51.17 ms at 48 kHz, and getDelay_nnr() reports it in samples.
// That is less than WDSP's own spectral NR (64 ms). Both models have the same
// latency — the larger one costs processor time, not delay.
//
// SIZE AND RATE ARE FIXED AT CONSTRUCTION in practice. setSize_nnr() and
// setSamplerate_nnr() tear the block down and rebuild it, which reallocates
// ~17 buffers, re-plans two FFTW_PATIENT transforms and re-deserialises both
// trained models. Control-path work only — never from an audio callback.
//
// COSTS, measured: ~13% of one modern x86 P-core for the Standard model and
// ~29% for Premium, per instance, plus ~9 MB RSS because each instance copies
// both models' weights into its own double blob.
//
// LOCKING IS THE CALLER'S. The setters below are the RXA properties without
// their ch[channel].csDSP section (AETHERSDR-PATCHES.md patch 5), so a host
// that drives them from a GUI thread while xnnr() runs on an audio thread
// must serialise them itself.
//
// MODEL FILES: every construction looks for wdsp_nnr_0.bin and wdsp_nnr_1.bin
// in the PROCESS'S WORKING DIRECTORY and prefers either over the built-in
// copy. A well-formed model with the wrong dimensions leaves that slot
