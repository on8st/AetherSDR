# AetherSDR patches to WDSP 2.10

The source snapshot is pinned to TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp commit
`b02d5bac675dd2f33ec2bab2b339f79a597c47dd` (`Release Version 2.10`).
AetherSDR carries ten local changes in the otherwise exact `Source/*.[ch]`
snapshot — four teardown corrections, two null/lifetime fixes, one added
accessor set, two channel-state fixes, and one performance change:

1. `upstream/nbp.c`: `destroy_notchdb()` now frees the `notchdb` object after
   its member allocations.
2. `upstream/nurbs.c`: `destroy_nurbs()` now frees the `nurbs` object after its
   member allocations.
3. `upstream/fmd.c` (`SetRXAFMNCde`) and `upstream/emph.c`
   (`SetTXAFMEmphNC`): `a->pfcimp = build_fcimp (...)`. Both functions tear
   down the filter-curve object and then rebuild it, but 2.10 discards the
   pointer `build_fcimp()` returns, so `a->pfcimp` still holds the address of
   the object `teardown_fcimp()` just freed. The two statements that follow —
   `exec_fcimp()` and `get_pfcpulse()` — then read and write through it, and
   the newly built object leaks.

   This is a **use-after-free on a live path, not a teardown-only leak**:
   `RXASetNC()` calls `SetRXAFMNCde()`, and `WdspChannel::open()` calls
   `RXASetNC()`, so every channel this host opens hits it. ASan reports it as
   a 4-byte read of freed memory in `exec_fcimp` (`fcurve.c:67`). It is new in
   2.10 — 2.00's `SetRXAFMNCde()` used `fc_impulse()` and owned the impulse
   buffer directly, so the object-lifetime mistake did not exist to make.

   `SetTXAFMEmphNC()` is the same mistake in the TX chain. This host does not
   currently call it, and it is fixed anyway: it is one line, it is the same
   refactor, and a known use-after-free left in a vendored tree is a trap for
   whoever calls it next.

   Reported upstream as TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#2; drop both lines when a release
   contains the assignment.
4. `upstream/channel.h`, `upstream/channel.c`, `upstream/main.c`,
   `upstream/iobuffs.c`, `upstream/iobuffs.h`: an exit handshake between the DSP worker and
   `pre_main_destroy()`. Upstream's only barrier between the detached worker's
   exit and `destroy_main()` / `post_main_destroy()` freeing the semaphore,
   mutex and buffers it still touches was `Sleep(25)` — a scheduling bet, not
   synchronization, and under load or a sanitizer the worker is still in
   `pthread_cond_wait()` on freed memory.

   `struct _ch` gains `mainGen`, `mainRunGen` and `mainExited`.
   `start_thread()` increments `mainGen` before every `_beginthread` (so the
   `SetInputBuffsize` / `SetDSPBuffsize` / `SetInputSamplerate` /
   `SetDSPSamplerate` rebuilds are covered too); `wdspmain()` publishes that
   value in `mainRunGen` at entry and stores it into `mainExited` as its last
   statement; `pre_main_destroy()` polls until `mainExited == mainGen`, with a
   1 s cap and then falls through, because upstream ignores thread-creation
   failure and an unbounded wait would hang `CloseChannel()`. The port's
   Interlocked shims are seq_cst `__atomic_*` builtins, so the edge is real to
   TSan, not merely quiet.

   **THE SINGLE POST IS NOT ENOUGH, and that was found in review of #5628.**
   The handshake posts one token to `Sem_BuffReady` so the worker wakes, sees
   `run == 0` and exits. That token can be STOLEN: `flush_iobuffs()`
   (`upstream/iobuffs.c`) drains the same semaphore with
   `while (!WaitForSingleObject (a->Sem_BuffReady, 1));`, and a stop that was
   clocked out leaves `flushChannel` runnable. If the flush thread gets its slot
   while the wait loop is running it consumes the worker's wake-up; the worker
   parks forever, the loop falls through its cap exactly as designed, and
   `destroy_iobuffs()` then closes the semaphore under a live waiter — where
   glibc's `pthread_cond_destroy()` blocks and never returns.

   So the loop now RE-POSTS the token on every iteration. The worker exits on
   `run == 0` however many tokens are outstanding and the `iob` is freed
   immediately afterwards, so the extras cost nothing. Measured by ten9876 on
   #5628: 7 hangs in 16 runs of `wdsp_channel_test` under 8-way parallel load on
   Arch/glibc, 0 in 32 with the re-post. **The hang does not reproduce on
   macOS/arm64 — 16 runs clean with the fix AND 16 clean without it — so this
   platform cannot confirm the fix, only that it causes no regression.**

   The general statement, for whoever refreshes this next: the handshake is
   sound only while nothing else drains `Sem_BuffReady`, and `flush_iobuffs()`
   does.

   Three details are not obvious and were all found in review of #5411:

   - **The worker had two exits; it now has one.** `dexchange()` (`iobuffs.c`)
     began `if (!_InterlockedAnd (&ch[channel].run, 1)) _endthread();`, so a
     worker inside the DSP switch when `run` cleared terminated there: with
     `csDSP` held, since `_endthread()` does not unwind and `wdspmain()` calls
     `dexchange()` inside the section, leaving `post_main_destroy()` to call
     `DeleteCriticalSection` on a locked section — and without ever reaching
     the exit handshake. `dexchange()` now **returns** non-zero instead
     (`int` rather than `void`, two call sites, both in `main.c`) and
     `wdspmain()` unlocks and leaves the loop, so the tail is the single exit.
     Making it single is what lets the handshake store a generation held in a
     **local**: an abandoned worker must not read its generation back out of
     `ch[]`, because by then that slot can belong to its successor and the
     acknowledgement would be made on the successor's behalf.
   - **`pre_main_destroy()` sets `exec_bypass` BEFORE clearing `run`**, the
     reverse of upstream's order, so a worker that has not yet read the bypass
     takes the bypass branch rather than unwinding through `dexchange()`. That
     narrows the window and saves a wakeup; correctness does not rest on it,
     because either route now leaves through `wdspmain()`'s tail.
   - **The flag is generation-valued, not 0/1.** If a wait ever falls through
     its cap the old worker is still alive and will store eventually. With a
     0/1 flag that late store would land on the *next* worker's slot and
     satisfy the following wait for free, silently disabling the handshake for
     the rest of the channel's life. A stale generation never equals the
     current `mainGen`, so it is inert.

   `flushChannel()` has the same detached shape and no handshake; it has not
   surfaced, and gets the same treatment if it does.

5. `upstream/nnr.c`, `upstream/nnr.h`: a standalone control surface for Neural
   Noise Reduction — `setRun_nnr`, `setPosition_nnr`, `setCmode_nnr`,
   `setMaskFloor_nnr`, `setTestMode_nnr`, `setAlpha_nnr`, `setAlphaKnee_nnr`,
   `setTau_nnr`, `setMaxGain_nnr` and `setSmooth_nnr`.

   Upstream exposes all ten only as `SetRXANNR*` properties, which index
   `rxa[channel]`. `create_nnr()`, `xnnr()` and `destroy_nnr()` touch neither
   `ch[]` nor `rxa[]`, so the block runs perfectly well outside a channel — the
   way `create_anbEXT()`/`xanbEXT()` already run the impulse blanker — but a
   host that does so can reach none of its settings, because `nnr->nets[]` and
   the `NNR_ALL_MODELS` macro are private to `nnr.c`. Only `setModel_nnr()` has
   a standalone form.

   Each added function is the body of its RXA property without the
   `ch[channel].csDSP` section, and each RXA property keeps working unchanged.
   Locking is the caller's, because a standalone block has no channel whose
   critical section to take.

   **Additive only** — no existing function is modified, which is what makes
   this survive a refresh as a clean re-apply rather than a conflict.

   Worth offering upstream: `create_nnr()` already takes `mask_floor` as a
   constructor argument, so the accessor is the setter that argument implies.
   Drop any function a future release provides itself.

6. `upstream/nnet.c`: `setAlpha_nnet()` and `setKnee_nnet()` now check `n->df`
   before writing through it.

   They are the only two of the six NNET tuning setters without that guard —
   `setSmooth_nnet()` checks `if (n->df)`, `setMaxGain_nnet()` and
   `setFloor_nnet()` check `if (n->ready)`, `setTau_nnet()` checks `if (n->cnd)`.
   A slot whose model fails to build never reaches `create_dfhead()`, so `df`
   stays NULL from `malloc0`, and `calc_nnr()` stores slot 0 unconditionally
   (unlike slots 1+, which it validates with `ok_nnet()`).

   **Reachable in a shipping configuration, and reproduced:** a well-formed
   model with different dimensions, named `wdsp_nnr_0.bin` in the process's
   working directory, is loaded in preference to the built-in (RFC #5684 §8
   keeps that lookup). WDSP's designed response is to pass audio through — and
   then the first `setAlpha`/`setKnee` write dereferences NULL. Confirmed as
   SIGSEGV against an unpatched build; exits cleanly with the guard.

   Latent upstream too, via `SetRXANNRAlpha`/`SetRXANNRAlphaKnee`, for any
   console that offers those controls. Reported as TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#4 with
   a fix in TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#5; drop this when a release carries the guard.

7. `upstream/channel.c`: `SetChannelState()` case 1 now cancels a pending
   down-ramp (`flush_slews()` under `csEXCH`) before it arms the up-ramp.

   Upstream's case 1 sets `slew.upflag`, `iob.ch_upslew` and `exchange` and
   clears `exec_bypass`, but never touches `iob.pc->slew.downflag`. The two
   flags are read independently on opposite sides of `fexchange0`/`fexchange2`
   — `upflag` gates the input, `downflag` gates the output — and the ramp only
   advances when the host clocks `fexchange*`. So a stop followed by a start
   before the host has clocked the down-ramp to completion leaves `downflag`
   set on a channel whose `state` is now 1, and the next few blocks finish the
   stale ramp. `downslew0`/`downslew2`'s completion arm does
   `InterlockedBitTestAndReset (&ch[channel].exchange, 0)`, so finishing that
   ramp **clears `exchange`**: every later `fexchange*` fails its opening
   `if (exchange)` test and returns having written nothing and reported no
   error, while `state` still reads 1. The channel is silently dead until it is
   closed and rebuilt, and no flag a host can read says so.

   The asymmetry is the point — only the *down* flag's completion clears
   `exchange`, so the mirror case (a stop taken with `upflag` still pending)
   needs nothing.

   `flush_slews()` rather than a bare clear of `downflag`, because the flag is
   not the whole ramp: `slew.dstate`/`dcount` are the state machine, and
   clearing the flag alone strands `dstate` mid-ramp for the *next* stop to
   resume from. It resets both directions, which is also what the up-ramp being
   armed wants. It clears `upflag`, hence the ordering: flush first, arm
   second. `csEXCH` because `dstate`/`dcount` are plain ints owned by
   `fexchange*`'s critical section — the same reason `SetChannelTDelayUp`/`Down`
   and `SetChannelTSlewUp`/`Down` already take it around their own
   `flush_slews()` — and because it makes the whole of case 1 atomic against
   `fexchange*`. No new lock-order edge: `csEXCH` is the inner of the two
   channel sections (`flushChannel` takes `csDSP` then `csEXCH`), nothing is
   taken inside it and nothing waits there, and the port maps
   `CRITICAL_SECTION` to a **recursive** pthread mutex. `ch[channel].flushflag`
   is deliberately left alone: the flush request belongs to the parked
   `flushChannel` thread, which only a completed ramp can release.

   **Unchanged by the 2.10 refresh.** Upstream's `channel.c` is byte-identical
   between `Release Version 2.00` and `Release Version 2.10` — as are
   `channel.h`, `iobuffs.c` and `main.c` — so 2.10 neither fixes this nor moves
   the code it is stated against, and the patch carries over verbatim.

   **Reported upstream as TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#6; drop this when a release
   carries the fix.** It is an upstream defect rather than an AetherSDR
   accommodation — any host that uses `SetChannelState` as its T/R verb, which
   is what `channel.c`'s own contract says it is for, produces stop/start pairs
   spaced by the keying turnaround and hits it.

   Found in review of #5628. Without it, `WdspChannel::setRunning(true)` on a
   channel whose stop has not been clocked out — the T/R edge `docs/HERMES.md`
   §13 row 9a contemplates — silently kills the channel while `isRunning()`
   reports true. `wdsp_channel_test`'s `runRestartDuringRampTest` covers all
   three ways in (no clocking at all, a restart inside the slew window, and a
   start after `reconfigure()` of a stopped channel) and fails on every one
   with this patch reverted.

   **This patch covers the ramp that is still pending, and NOTHING ELSE.** The
   text here first claimed it made stop/start pairs safe at any spacing; that
   was true only inside the ramp, and false just past it. See patch 8.

8. `upstream/channel.c`: `SetChannelState()` case 1 now waits out a flush that
   a *completed* down-ramp already requested, before it arms the up-ramp.

   Patch 7 cancels a ramp that is still **pending**. It cannot cancel a flush
   that a ramp which already **completed** has requested. At that completion
   `fexchange0`/`fexchange2` clear `exchange` and release `Sem_Flush`
   (`iobuffs.c`), and the `flushChannel` thread is left runnable but not
   necessarily scheduled. When it does run it takes `csDSP` then `csEXCH`,
   flushes, and does `InterlockedBitTestAndSet (&a->exec_bypass, 0)`. Arm in
   that window and `flushChannel` sets `exec_bypass` *after* case 1 cleared it;
   `wdspmain` then skips `dexchange`/`xrxa` entirely (`main.c`) and the worker
   produces nothing for a channel whose `state` reads 1.

   Two failure modes, both measured on this tree with a probe that stops,
   clocks N blocks at the 256/48 kHz cadence, starts with **no gap**, and then
   asks for audio:

   | mode | sweep | patch 7 only | with patch 8 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | non-blocking (what production uses) | spacings 0-10, 40 trials each | 42 of 440 dead — 24 at spacing 3, 18 at spacing 4, **none at 0-2** | 0 of 440 |
   | blocking | spacings 0-6, 20 trials each | 20 of 140 hung — all at spacing 3 | 0 of 140, no hang |

   A control that sleeps 20 ms before each start, giving the flush thread its
   slot, is 0 of 440 with patch 7 alone. The ramp is exactly three blocks here
   (BEGIN 1 + DOWNSLEW `ntdown` + 1 + ZERO `out_size` + 1 = 739 samples at
   `out_size` 256), so spacing 3 is the first at which it completes — which is
   why nothing dies at 0-2, the window patch 7 already covered.

   The blocking hang is a hard one: with `exec_bypass` set the worker never
   releases `Sem_OutReady`, so `fexchange2`'s
   `if (a->bfo) WaitForSingleObject (a->Sem_OutReady, INFINITE)` never returns.
   Six thread samples of six separate stalls all showed that two-thread
   starvation — host parked in `fexchange2` holding `csEXCH`, `flushChannel`
   finished and back on `Sem_Flush`, worker idle on `Sem_BuffReady`. A
   three-way lock cycle (`flushChannel` holding `csDSP` and blocking on the
   `csEXCH` the parked host holds, worker then blocking on `csDSP`) is
   reachable from the same window on a different interleaving; no sample caught
   it, and it is not what the measurements above are evidence of.

   The wait predicate is `exchange` clear **and** `flushflag` set, which names
   the completed-ramp case and only it: a pending ramp leaves `exchange` set;
   case 0's dmode-1 timeout force-clears both; `pre_main_build` clears
   `flushflag`, so `OpenChannel`'s start never waits; and every in-tree restore
   call (`SetDSPBuffsize`, `SetDSPSamplerate`, `RXASetNC`, `TXASetNC`) reaches
   case 1 only after its own `SetChannelState(0, 1)`, which leaves `flushflag`
   clear on both exits. The only caller that can reach the wait is a host that
   stopped with dmode 0 and clocked the ramp out.

   **Outside `csEXCH`, and that is load-bearing.** `flushChannel` needs
   `csEXCH` to finish and clear `flushflag`, so waiting while holding it would
   guarantee the timeout instead of the flush. The waiting thread holds no
   channel lock at all, and the host cannot be inside `fexchange*` on it —
   `WdspChannel::setRunning()` and `open()` both take the control fence, which
   refuses while a `processIq()` callback is in flight — so the wait cannot
   join the cycle above. Nothing that must run to satisfy it can be blocked by
   it either: `csDSP` is never held across an unbounded wait (`dexchange` only
   memcpys and releases), and `flush_iobuffs`'s `Sem_BuffReady` drain is a 1 ms
   -timeout poll.

   **Bounded** by case 0's existing `count`/`timeout`, for the same reason
   patch 4 bounds its handshake: a flush thread that never runs must not hang a
   start forever, and falling through after the cap is exactly today's
   behaviour, no worse. Cost, over 132 starts across spacings 0-10:
   `setRunning(true)` mean 251 us, max 3.1 ms, against mean 0.83 us / max
   3.1 us with the patch reverted. The owner-side stops in `Hl2RxDsp` and
   `AnanRxDsp` are `setRunning(false)` — case 0 — and take no new wait at all.

   **Unchanged by the 2.10 refresh**, for the same reason patch 7 is: the
   `flushChannel`/`Sem_Flush`/`exec_bypass` machinery this is stated against
   lives in `channel.c`, `iobuffs.c` and `main.c`, all three byte-identical
   upstream between 2.00 and 2.10.

   **Reported upstream as TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#7; drop this when a release
   carries the fix.** Upstream for the same reason patch 7 is, and the blocking
   variant is the one that will bite the next integrator hardest: it parks the
   host in `fexchange2` forever rather than merely silencing it.

   Found by K5PTB in review of #5628, on the shape he suggested.
   `runRestartDuringRampTest`'s scenario table now straddles the ramp:
   spacings 0 and 1 inside it, 3, 4 and 5 at and past its completion, restarted
   with no gap. With this patch reverted it goes red on one of those three rows
   in 5 of 5 runs — which row varies, so all three earn their place. The
   post-restart clocking runs on its own thread under a 20 s deadline, because
   the blocking failure is a hang, and inline it would be a ctest timeout
   rather than a message anyone can read.

   NOT MEASURED ON HARDWARE. The probe is synthetic; no radio has run any of
   this.

9. `upstream/channel.c`, `upstream/iobuffs.c`, `upstream/iobuffs.h`: the
   `flushChannel` exit handshake now runs in `pre_main_destroy()`, before
   `destroy_main()`, instead of in `destroy_iobuffs()` after it.

   **This is a move, not a new mechanism.** Upstream already had the handshake:
   `destroy_iobuffs()` sets `flush_bypass`, releases `Sem_Flush` so a parked
   thread wakes and sees it, and waits for the thread's own reset of
   `flush_bypass` at the tail of `flushChannel()`. What was wrong was where it
   ran. `CloseChannel()` is `pre_main_destroy(); destroy_main();
   post_main_destroy()`, and `destroy_iobuffs()` is reached only from the third
   — so the flush thread was still live across `destroy_main()`, which is
   `destroy_rxa()`/`destroy_txa()`, exactly the chain `flush_main()` ->
   `flush_rxa()` walks. The patch adds a `quiesce_flush()` function holding that
   code and calls it from both ends of the pair; `destroy_iobuffs()` keeps its
   call and normally finds the work already done.

   Patch 4 gave the `wdspmain` worker an exit handshake and said of this thread:
   *"`flushChannel()` has the same detached shape and no handshake; it has not
   surfaced, and gets the same treatment if it does."* It has surfaced.

   **What makes it reachable is a completed down-ramp.** At the completion of
   the ramp, `fexchange0`/`fexchange2` clear `exchange` and release `Sem_Flush`
   (`iobuffs.c`), leaving `flushChannel` runnable. Before
   `WdspChannel::setRunning()` there was no way to reach that state and then
   close: the only stop was `close()`'s own, taken behind the host's control
   fence with nothing left to call `fexchange*`, so the ramp never completed and
   the thread stayed parked through the whole of teardown. A host that stops a
   channel, keeps clocking it — which is what `WdspChannel.h` now documents as
   correct usage, and what the T/R mute of `docs/HERMES.md` §13 row 9a will do —
   and then destroys it, hands `destroy_rxa()` a chain another thread is inside.

   **MEASURED, before it was fixed.** macOS arm64, AppleClang, RelWithDebInfo,
   one trial per process. TWO BUILDS OF THE SAME SOURCE are reported separately
   and deliberately: the rate is a property of the schedule and the heap, not of
   the defect, and quoting one figure would misrepresent it.

   Build A, DFNR not linked:

   | shape | non-blocking | blocking |
   |---|---|---|
   | create -> clock 32 -> destroy (never stopped) | clean 10/10 | clean 10/10 |
   | create -> clock 32 -> `setRunning(false)` -> destroy | clean 10/10 | clean 10/10 |
   | create -> clock 32 -> `setRunning(false)` -> **clock 32** -> destroy | **crashed 30/30** | clean 30/30 |
   | the same, with a 50 ms sleep before the destroy | clean 30/30 | — |

   Build B, DFNR linked (which moves the heap), same source:

   | shape | non-blocking | blocking |
   |---|---|---|
   | never stopped; and stopped with nothing clocked | clean 15/15 each | — |
   | stopped **and clocked** | **crashed 8/30** | **crashed 1/30** |

   The single distinguishing variable is the clocking after the stop, and the
   sleep control is what identifies the flush thread rather than the stop itself.
   Within build A the crashing shape measured 3 of 10, then 16 of 30, then 30 of
   30 across relinks of identical source, so no one figure should be read as
   "the" rate; what is stable is that the shape faults and its two neighbours do
   not. Build B is the one that matters for the blocking mode: 1 of 30 is small
   but not zero, so this is not a mode-specific defect — the suite's own cases,
   which are all `blockForOutput = true`, are exposed, just far less often here
   than the non-blocking form production uses.

   `lldb` on a faulting run shows both halves at once — thread 1 in
   `destroy_fmd` <- `destroy_rxa` <- `destroy_main` <- `CloseChannel` <-
   `WdspChannel::close`, thread 4 in `flush_emnr` <- `flush_rxa` <-
   `flush_main` <- `flushChannel`. With patch 9 the crashing shape is clean
   80/80 in build B, 40 in each output mode.

   @ten9876 reported it against Arch/gcc, where he measured 10 of 10 and a
   `pthread_cond_destroy` hang variant in `wdsp_channel_test` itself, 2 runs in
   3. The crash reproduces here; the hang does not — 35 runs of the unfixed
   suite, 0 hangs. See patch 4's note on `_beginthread` failure and on the
   worker's exit handshake for the part of that difference worth keeping in
   view.

   **BOUNDED, where upstream's spin was not**, at 1000 x `Sleep(1)` to match
   patch 4's handshake and for the reason patch 4 gives: upstream ignores
   `_beginthread()` failure, and an unbounded wait on a thread that was never
   created would hang `CloseChannel()` forever. This is the one respect in which
   the moved code is not verbatim, and it is a deliberate trade rather than an
   oversight.

   **BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE CAP COSTS, because an earlier draft of this entry
   said "no worse than today" and that is not exact** (review of #5628).
   Upstream's wait was `while (InterlockedAnd (&a->flush_bypass, 0xffffffff))
   Sleep(1);` — unbounded, so it could not fall through at all. This one can,
   and on exhaustion `flush_quiesced` is set on the way out regardless, so
   `destroy_iobuffs()`'s own call returns immediately and the `CloseHandle
   (a->Sem_Flush)` five lines later runs under a flush thread that may still be
   parked on it. That is the same `pthread_cond_destroy()`-under-a-live-waiter
   shape patch 4's re-post exists to close, reached by a different door. The
   trade is still right — a guaranteed hang on a thread that was never created
   is worse than a 1 s wait that in practice never exhausts, and the flush
   thread's bypass path is a wake, a flag read and an exit — but the bound
   INHERITS patch 4's failure mode rather than being free of it, and that is
   worth knowing before anyone shortens the cap.

   **IDEMPOTENT**, via a new `flush_quiesced` bit in `struct _iobuffs`, because
   both ends of the `pre_main_destroy()`/`post_main_destroy()` pair call it and
   a second pass must not re-arm a `flush_bypass` that no thread is left to
   acknowledge — that would burn the whole cap on every close. Per-`iob`, not
   per-channel-slot, so patch 4's generation hazard does not arise: the `iob` is
   freed and reallocated on every build.

   **AFTER patch 4's worker wait, not before.** `flushChannel()` takes `csDSP`,
   which the worker holds across `dexchange()`, so quiescing the flush thread
   first could make `pre_main_destroy()` wait out the worker's block through a
   second thread. With the worker already gone both channel sections are free.

   **Unchanged by the 2.10 refresh**, for the same reason patches 7 and 8 are:
   `channel.c`, `iobuffs.c`, `iobuffs.h` and `main.c` are byte-identical
   upstream between `Release Version 2.00` and `Release Version 2.10`.

   **Reported upstream as TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#8; drop this when a release
   carries the fix.** Upstream, and the most serious of the three — it is a
   use-after-free reachable by any host that stops a channel, keeps clocking it
   and then closes, which is the natural shape for a T/R mute.

   Found by @ten9876 in review of #5628. Pinned by `wdsp_channel_test`'s
   `runCloseAfterStoppedClockingTest`, which drives the crashing shape 24 times
   in one process and goes red — as a signal, not a message, because there is no
   assertion that catches a use-after-free from inside the process committing it
   — in 5 of 5 runs with this patch reverted.

   NOT MEASURED ON HARDWARE. The probe is synthetic; no radio has run any of
   this.

10. `upstream/firmin.c`: `plan_fircore()` builds the minimum-phase workspace
    only when `a->mp` is set, and `calc_fircore()` builds it on first use
    (`ensure_minphase()`) so `setMp_fircore()` can still turn minimum phase on at
    any time. `deplan_fircore()` tolerates the absent object.

    ONE NEW PROPERTY THIS GIVES `setMp_fircore()`: it can now build FFTW plans,
    which it never could before, because `ensure_minphase()` reaches
    `create_minphase()`'s four `FFTW_PATIENT` plans. FFTW planning is not
    thread-safe. Today that is harmless — the only caller of `RXASetMP()` is
    `WdspChannel::open()`, which holds the setup mutex, and `setNc_fircore()`
    already planned from that same place. **If anything ever starts toggling
    minimum phase at runtime, outside that mutex, this is the line to revisit.**
    Raised by the reviewer on #5697 and recorded here rather than left in a
    review thread.

    Upstream ends `plan_fircore()` with an unconditional
    `a->pminphase = create_minphase (a->nc, a->pfactor)`, with no reference to
    `a->mp`. The only consumer is the `if (a->mp)` branch of `calc_fircore()`.
    `WdspChannel::Config::minimumPhase` is `false` and nothing in this tree sets
    it, so `RXASetMP()` passes 0 and **every** minimum-phase workspace an RX
    channel builds is dead on arrival.

    `create_minphase()` (`fir.c`) allocates six `complex` buffers and one
    `double` buffer at `N * pfactor` elements -- 104 bytes per element in total --
    and creates **four `FFTW_PATIENT` plans** of that length.

    **The standing cost is the resident workspace, not the planning.** An earlier
    draft of this note led with plan-construction time; that overstated it.
    `WdspChannel::open()` calls `loadWisdomOnce()` before the first plan and
    exports afterwards, and FFTW wisdom is keyed on the (transform kind, size)
    pair, so on a warm cache `FFTW_PATIENT` imports instead of re-measuring and
    the planner cost is already largely amortised. What is NOT amortised is the
    memory: the buffers are allocated on every open, held for the life of the
    channel, and never read. Plan time is the **cold-cache** case -- a first run,
    a cleared cache, a CI container, a session whose export never ran -- and
    there it does bite, because these are among the largest geometries the
    channel plans. Treat it as the cold-start half of the argument, not the
    headline.

    Counted, not assumed, by instrumenting `create_fircore()` and
    `create_minphase()` and opening one channel: **an RX channel builds 13
    fircores, 12 of them `mp == 0`.** The one that is not is `rxa[].eqp`
    (`nc = 16384`, `pfactor` 4), which upstream creates with the minimum-phase
    flag set; its workspace is real and this patch keeps it. `RXASetNC()`
    re-plans six of the twelve, so a single RX open at
    `Hl2RxDsp::kRxFilterTaps` = 8192 makes **19 `create_minphase()` calls, 18 of
    them for `mp == 0` cores -- 72 dead `FFTW_PATIENT` plans**, at lengths
    131072 (x3), 65536, 32768 (x8), 8192 (x5) and 4096.
    A TX channel builds 7 fircores, 6 of them `mp == 0`.

    Measured against `wdspPortOutstandingAllocations()` /
    `wdspPortAllocationSequence()` (macOS arm64, one RX open at 8192 taps,
    `mp == 0`): live WDSP allocations while the channel is open fall from 1300 to
    1204, and allocations made during the open from 1518 to 1374. `create_minphase()`
    makes 8 allocations, so that is exactly 12 fewer objects held and 18 fewer
    built -- the counted inventory, independently. Before the patch, `mp == 1`
    and `mp == 0` hold the identical 1300; after it, `mp == 1` holds 1252, the
    48 allocations of the six cores `RXASetMP()` reaches.

    **Two different totals come out of those counts, and they must not be
    confused.** `RXASetNC()` reaches its six cores through `setNc_fircore()`,
    which calls `deplan_fircore()` BEFORE `plan_fircore()` -- so those six
    workspaces are built at `nc = 2048`, freed, and built again at 8192. They
    appear twice in the built list and once in the resident one. Showing the
    working, in `N * pfactor` elements at 104 bytes each:

    | quantity | elements | bytes |
    |---|---|---|
    | Built, dead, across one RX open (18 calls: 131072 x3, 65536, 32768 x8, 8192 x5, 4096) | 765,952 | **~79.7 MB** |
    | less the six pre-`RXASetNC` workspaces `setNc_fircore()` frees (32768 x3 + 8192 x3) | -122,880 | -~12.8 MB |
    | **Resident, dead, once the channel is open** (12 cores: 131072 x3, 65536, 32768 x5, 8192 x2, 4096) | **643,072** | **~66.9 MB** |

    The figure this note quotes is the **resident** one. Because the frees
    precede the allocations and every core only grows, resident is also the peak
    concurrent figure: **~66.9 MB of never-executed workspace per RX channel at
    8192 taps**. The ~79.7 MB is allocation churn across the open, not memory
    ever held at once. At WDSP's own `max(2048, dsp_size)` default the two
    coincide at ~28.5 MB, because `RXASetNC(2048)` changes no `nc` and re-plans
    nothing; likewise ~16.2 MB per TX channel.

    Every byte figure above is arithmetic on the counted inventory and
    `create_minphase()`'s own allocation sizes. **No memory was measured**, here
    or on hardware, and nothing in this work ran a radio.

    This is shared DSP -- **every backend that opens a `WdspChannel` pays it**,
    not only the HL2, and the HL2's tap count only sets how much.

    **Drop condition.** This is the one entry here that is a performance change
    rather than a correctness fix, so it is also the one a maintainer may simply
    decline to carry. Drop it if upstream makes the construction conditional
    itself; drop it if this tree ever sets `Config::minimumPhase` true on every
    path, since the workspace would then be wanted everywhere and the laziness
    would buy nothing. **Not reported upstream yet** -- unlike patch 3, which is
    TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#2, this one has no upstream issue behind it.

Without the first two, opening and closing one RX channel leaks one `notchdb`
object and two NURBS objects. `wdsp_channel_test` detects that deterministically.
Without the third, every channel open reads and writes freed memory; ASan fails
`wdsp_channel_test` immediately.
Without the fourth, every channel close is a use-after-free race on the
worker thread; `wdsp_channel_test` and the HL2 backend tests show it under
ThreadSanitizer.
Without the fifth, the only NNR setting a host outside an RXA channel can
change is the model slot.
Without the sixth, `nnr_controls_test`'s scenario segfaults: a model file with
the wrong dimensions in the working directory leaves slot 0 not-ready, and the
first alpha or knee write goes through a null `df`.
Without the seventh, a stop immediately followed by a start — before the host has
clocked the down-ramp out — silently and permanently disables the channel;
`wdsp_channel_test` shows it deterministically.
Without the eighth, a start taken just *after* that ramp completes does the same
thing by a different route, and in the blocking form hangs the host outright;
`wdsp_channel_test` shows it, and the probe behind the patch measures it.
Without the ninth, closing a channel that was stopped and then clocked frees the
RXA chain under a live `flushChannel` thread; `wdsp_channel_test` crashes.

The tenth changes no filter output: at `mp == 0` the removed object was never
read, and at `mp == 1` the same workspace is built, one call later. It is the
only one of the ten that makes a pointer legitimately null, so the risk it
carries is a null dereference in `mp_imp_exec()` or a double teardown in
`deplan_fircore()`, not a leak. `wdsp_channel_test`'s new
`runMinimumPhaseWorkspaceTest` is the cover: it is the first test in this tree
to set `Config::minimumPhase`, and because `WdspChannel::open()` calls
`RXASetNC()` before `RXASetMP()` it is the case that walks the lazy build. An
ASan build of the vendored library alone, cycling `open` / `RXASetNC` /
`RXASetMP(1)` / `RXASetNC` / `RXASetMP(0)` / `close` twice plus a TX open,
reported nothing on macOS arm64.

**Marking convention.** Patches 4, 7, 8 and 9 carry `// AetherSDR patch N:` comments
at every edited site, so `grep -rn "AetherSDR patch" third_party/wdsp/` finds
them all. Patches 1-3 carry no marker — 1 and 2 are single added `_aligned_free`
lines and 3 is a single added assignment — and are findable only from this file.
New patches use the marker.
 Patch 10 is the exception: its sites are marked `// AetherSDR:` with no
number, so the grep above does not find them; it is findable from this file
and from `ensure_minphase` in `upstream/firmin.c`.

When refreshing WDSP, first check whether upstream has made each change
itself. The ten are different shapes, so grep for the shape, not for a free:

- **patches 1-2** -- a trailing `_aligned_free()` of the object itself at the
  end of `destroy_notchdb()` / `destroy_nurbs()`.
- **patch 3** -- the `a->pfcimp = build_fcimp (...)` **assignment** in
  `SetRXAFMNCde()` and `SetTXAFMEmphNC()` (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#2). This one is
  a use-after-free fixed by capturing a return value, **not a free**: looking
  for an added free will report the fix absent when it has landed, or have you
  reapply a patch upstream already carries.
- **patch 4** -- the `mainGen` / `mainRunGen` / `mainExited` exit handshake
  between the DSP worker and `pre_main_destroy()`.
- **patch 5** -- standalone `set*_nnr()` accessors alongside the `SetRXANNR*`
  properties.
- **patch 6** -- an `n->df` guard in `setAlpha_nnet()` and `setKnee_nnet()`
  (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#4, fix in TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#5).
- **patch 7** -- `SetChannelState()` case 1 clearing a still-pending
  `slew.downflag` / `iob.ch_upslew` down-ramp before it arms the up-ramp
  (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#6).
- **patch 8** -- `SetChannelState()` case 1 waiting, outside `csEXCH` and under
  case 0's existing bound, for `exchange` clear **and** `flushflag` set
  (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#7).
- **patch 9** -- a `quiesce_flush()` holding the `flush_bypass` / `Sem_Flush`
  handshake, called from `pre_main_destroy()` rather than only from
  `destroy_iobuffs()` (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-wdsp#8).
- **patch 10** -- an `a->mp` guard on the `create_minphase()` call at the end of
  `plan_fircore()`, and a build-on-first-use in `calc_fircore()`.

Drop any local patch upstream now carries. Otherwise reapply only these minimal
changes and run the lifecycle test under AddressSanitizer on every supported
platform.
