// #5497 — the unkey mute is released AFTER the radio stops transmitting, not
// before it. Stated as an ORDERING, because that is what the defect is.
//
// THE DEFECT, precisely. Hl2Backend::applyKeying() queued the demodulator's
// unmute and, sixty-odd lines later in the same function, queued the MOX-off.
// Both targets live on the SAME thread — Hl2RxDsp and MetisClient are both
// moved to Hl2Backend's I/O thread — and both edges ride Qt::QueuedConnection,
// so delivery is FIFO in posting order. The unmute was not racing the MOX-off
// and did not sometimes lose: it was guaranteed to be delivered first. The
// demodulator listened at full gain while the PA was still up, for the whole
// T/R turnaround, on every unkey. Measured on ON8ST's own HL2 into a dummy
// load, that is a burst 57.5 dB above the receiver's own resting floor which
// leaves the float domain at +10.6 dBFS.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, and why in this shape:
//
//   1. THE ORDERING, not the delay. After key-up plus one full turn of the I/O
//      thread's event loop the MOX-off has been APPLIED and the demodulator is
//      STILL MUTED. On stock the same turn delivers both, so the demodulator is
//      already listening — the test fails there, which is the point.
//
//   2. THE POSITIVE CONTROL, and it is not optional here. "Still muted after
//      one turn" is also what a dropped invokeMethod, a renamed slot, a DSP
//      that was never attached and a test that forgot to pump its event loop
//      all look like. So the same sequence is run with the hold set to ZERO and
//      the release is required to be IMMEDIATE. That is the one arrangement in
//      which "still muted at 0 ms" can only mean the hold — every other
//      explanation above would keep it muted at zero too.
//
//   3. THE RE-KEY GUARD. Key up, wait half the hold, key down again, wait past
//      the ORIGINAL expiry: still muted. A hold that fired on its own schedule
//      would unmute in the middle of the second transmission, which is the
//      failure the hold exists to prevent, arriving by a different door.
//
//   4. THE MIXER GATES ON THE SAME FLAG. mixReceiverAudio()'s early return used
//      to read `m_keyed && !m_txMonitor` while the demodulator was muted on an
//      expression evaluated elsewhere. Deferring one and not the other would
//      have pushed the whole hold into the engine as digital ZEROS; gating both
//      on m_rxAudioMuted makes it a continued GAP instead.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT, said here rather than left to be discovered: any
// audio level, anything about the HL2's actual T/R turnaround, and whether 70
// ms is the right number. Those are bench questions and #5497 carries the
// measurements. This is an ordering test with a clock in it.
//
// NO WDSP, NO SOCKET, NO RADIO. The probe Hl2RxDsp is never configure()d, so it
// owns no WDSP channel; setAudioMuted() on an unconfigured chain is a plain
// member write plus a null-checked noise-blanker hold. MetisClient is never
// start()ed — the transmit gate is opened directly, exactly as
// hl2_tx_gate_test.cpp does it, and MOX is read back from the client's own
// applied state on the thread that owns it.
