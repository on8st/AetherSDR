// "ADD PANADAPTER" MUST NOT HOLD THE GUI THREAD, AND MUST NOT HOLD THE I/O ONE.
//
// Hl2Backend::createPanadapter() configured the new receiver's DSP over a
// Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection. Two threads waited on that, not one, and the
// second is the expensive one:
//
//   * the GUI thread, because the call does not return until WDSP has opened a
//     channel and FFTW has planned — the visible half, and the smaller fault;
//
//   * m_ioThread, because that is where Hl2RxDsp LIVES. MetisClient paces EP2
//     from a 2 ms timer on that thread and drains EP6 on it, and iqBlocksReady
//     is a Qt::DirectConnection straight into processIqBlock(). So the open ran
//     ON the thread that feeds the radio: every other receiver's audio stopped
//     for the duration, and so did EP2. docs/HERMES.md §20.8 is explicit that
//     the gateware watchdog answers a gap in EP2 by halting the stream.
//
// #5783 removed exactly this for the pan-bandwidth rebuild and said in its own
// body that createPanadapter() still did it. This is that last site.
//
// ── WHY THE OBVIOUS TEST IS NOT A TEST ───────────────────────────────────
//
// "The panadapter still appears" proves nothing: it passed before the change,
// it passes after it, and it would pass again if someone restored the blocking
// call tomorrow. The assertion has to FAIL when the connection type goes back.
//
// So both cases below work the same way: OCCUPY the thread that must not be
// waited on for a known interval, then measure. Nothing here times WDSP or
// FFTW — the interval is one this test chose, and the margin is against that.
//
//   CASE 1  hold m_ioThread for kHoldMs, then call createPanadapter() and time
//           it. A Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection into an occupied event loop
//           cannot return before that loop is free, so the old code scores
//           >= kHoldMs. The new code posts and returns.
//
//   CASE 2  hold the BUILD thread instead and call createPanadapter(). It must
//           still return at once, and no WDSP channel may be open while that
//           thread is held — which is what proves the open actually goes
//           THERE, rather than the GUI thread having been let go by some
//           other means.
//
// Case 2 is the one that catches a half-fix. A change that merely moved the
// wait from the GUI thread to the I/O thread would pass case 1 and fail case 2,
// because the channel would be open with the build thread still idle.
//
// ── AND ONE ASSERTION POINTING THE OTHER WAY ─────────────────────────────
//
// Case 1 also pins what must NOT become asynchronous. The BUILD moved off the
// GUI thread; the ANNOUNCEMENT did not, and two callers depend on that:
// TciServer diffs m_model->slices() the instant createPanadapter() returns (its
// own comment says "the seam create is SYNCHRONOUS"), and
// MainWindow::createPansSequentially() diffs panadapters() 300 ms later. So
// case 1 requires the pan to be announced while the I/O thread is still held —
// not merely eventually, but before anything on that thread could have run.
//
// ── AND TWO CASES ABOUT IDENTITY, WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT MOVED ────
//
// Making the build asynchronous made the COMPLETION arrive at a moment the
// caller does not choose, and a completion has to find the receiver it was
// started for. It resolves by UI NUMBER — and a UI number is REUSED.
// Hl2ReceiverMap::append() hands out the LOWEST FREE one, deliberately (its own
// comment explains that a monotonic counter overran the seam's slice-id space),
// so closing a receiver while its chain builds and opening another puts the
// SAME UI number on a DIFFERENT receiver, with a completion still in flight for
// the first.
//
//   CASE 3  the stale completion FAILED (the chain was closed mid-build, so the
//           swap hop's QPointer was null). Landing it on the reuser tears down a
//           live receiver and tells the operator "the receiver was closed while
//           its chain was building" about a pane they just opened.
//
//   CASE 4  the stale completion SUCCEEDED (the swap won the race against
//           deleteLater). Landing it on the reuser writes the DEAD channel's
//           WDSP id onto it and clears its dspBuildInFlight — while its own
//           build is still running.
//
// BOTH ARE FORCED, NOT HOPED FOR. Nothing below waits a fixed time for a race
// to happen: `ThreadHold` stops a thread on a semaphore and does not return
// until it has actually stopped, and case 4's wait for the first build to land
// polls the I/O thread over BLOCKING invokes precisely because those do not pump
// the GUI event loop — so the completion sits in the GUI queue, undelivered, for
// exactly as long as the test wants it to. A race test that passes because the
// race did not happen is worth nothing; these two cannot pass that way, because
// the interleaving is a consequence of the semaphore and not of the scheduler.
//
// ── AND ONE CASE ABOUT THE OTHER THING AN EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT ALLOWS ──────
//
//   CASE 5  the receiver is announced before its build starts, so it can be
//           SELECTED while the build runs — transmit moved onto it, or the
//           active slice. If the build then FAILS, the erase has to take both
//           roles somewhere that exists. hl2RoleAfterRemove() returns -1 for
//           "the role was the removed receiver" by contract, and storing that
//           leaves rx(m_txDdc) null: no slice owns transmit, and every later
//           key attempt dies in RadioModel's interlock saying so, with nothing
//           from the backend to explain it.
//
// Case 5 is forced the same way cases 3 and 4 are, in both directions at once:
// the build FAILS through Hl2RxDsp::buildChannel()'s own non-positive-rate
// guard rather than a stub, and the roles are ON the doomed receiver because
// the case puts them there through the public API and asserts they landed
// before it releases anything. It also ends on a control — the next build must
// still succeed — so it cannot pass on a fixture that has simply stopped being
// able to build.
//
// NO RADIO IS NEEDED. The connect's discovery probe times out on a dead port,
// the session comes up on conservative defaults, and the link edge is injected
// — nothing below asserts anything about the wire.

//
// THE DEFECT THIS CHANGE INTRODUCED, AND THE REASON IT IS NEW. Publishing the
// slice BEFORE the build starts is the point of this PR — it is what stops
// TciServer and MainWindow diffing a model the new receiver is not in yet — and
// it also makes that receiver SELECTABLE for the whole length of its build.
// setTxSlice() and setActiveSlice() need only ddcForSlice() and rx(); neither
// reads r->dsp, so both will put a role on a receiver whose chain does not
// exist. Before this PR they could not: the receiver was invisible outside
// Hl2Backend until its chain was open, which is exactly what the old comment on
// the failure path was relying on when it said the `==` case "cannot arise
// here".
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG THEN. finishReceiverDspBuild()'s failure path erases the
// receiver and moved both roles with hl2RoleAfterRemove() alone. That helper
// answers "the role WAS the removed receiver" with -1 BY CONTRACT, so the
// caller can choose a new home. Nothing chose one. rx(-1) is nullptr, so
// transmit owned no slice at all: every later key attempt dies in RadioModel's
// interlock with "No transmit slice is assigned", and nothing down here says
// why — the silent refusal removePanadapter() documents at length and moves
// transmit to DDC 0 to avoid.
//
// FORCED IN BOTH HALVES, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS WORTH RUNNING:
//
//   * the build FAILS because the committed rate is 0 when the Config is
//     snapshotted — the guard on the first line of Hl2RxDsp::buildChannel(),
//     reached the way a malformed params override reaches it. Not a stub, not a
//     timing window, and not something that might not happen.
//   * the roles are ON the failing receiver because this case puts them there
//     through the public API and then ASSERTS they landed, before releasing
//     anything.
//
// A version of this case that reached neither would pass while proving nothing,
// so the two preconditions are checked, the failure itself is checked, and the
// case ends on a control that would catch a fixture which had simply stopped
// being able to build.
