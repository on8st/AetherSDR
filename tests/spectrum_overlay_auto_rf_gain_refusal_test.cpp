// WHAT A REFUSED "Auto" TICK LEAVES BEHIND ON THE CHECKBOX, and what a later
// successful arm has to take away again.
//
// The GUI half of #5817 puts the backend's refusal sentence on the Auto
// checkbox's ACCESSIBLE DESCRIPTION, because the operator who cannot see the
// panadapter is the one least able to guess why a box sprang back -- a
// transient card and a status-bar message are both effectively invisible to AT
// clients. Review found that half regressing on the very path it fixes: the
// description was set and never cleared, so after the operator followed the
// remedy and armed for real, a running control went on announcing "declined --
// your setting has not been changed", and its standing help tooltip was gone
// for the session.
//
// So the assertions here are about the CLEAR, not the set. The ordering one is
// load-bearing and easy to get wrong: on the operator's retry the box is
// ALREADY checked (they ticked it, the toggle fired), so setAutoRfGainEnabled
// takes its "already there" early return -- a clear written after that return
// never runs on the one path it exists for.
//
// Offscreen and widget-only: a plain QWidget parent, no MainWindow, no
// SpectrumWidget, no backend, no sockets.
