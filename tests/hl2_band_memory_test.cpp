// Per-band LNA memory across a connect that pins the gain.
//
// The defect these cover is a SILENT, DELAYED loss of operator calibration.
// A connect carrying the namespaced lnaGainDb param sets the live gain to the
// pinned value while the start band's stored entry says something else; the
// first band change then calls rememberCurrentBandState(), which writes the
// live value back over that entry. Nothing is wrong at connect, nothing warns,
// and the band that used to be calibrated comes up on the pinned value in every
// later session as though the operator had chosen it.
//
// This station lost 20 m that way during a witnessed run on 2026-09-03: the
// stored -12 dB entry was replaced by the launch's pinned value, and the loss
// was only visible because a backup had been taken minutes earlier.
//
// Hl2Backend evaluates these same functions rather than its own copy, so what
// passes here is what the radio runs
// (core/backends/hl2/Hl2BandMemoryPolicy.h).
