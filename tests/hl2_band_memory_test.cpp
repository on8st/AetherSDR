// Per-band LNA memory across a connect that pins the gain.
//
// The defect these cover is a SILENT, DELAYED loss of operator calibration.
// A connect carrying the namespaced lnaGainDb param sets the live gain to the
// pinned value while the start band's stored entry says something else; the
// first band change then calls rememberCurrentBandState(), which writes the
// live value back over that entry. Nothing is wrong at connect, nothing warns,
// and the band that used to be calibrated comes up on the pinned value in every
// later session as though the operator had chosen it.
//
// NO FIELD OBSERVATION IS CLAIMED FOR THIS MECHANISM. An earlier version of
// this comment cited a bench run in which 40 m went from -6 dB to -12 dB. That
// loss is real but it is NOT this defect: neither launch supplied a
// lnaGainDb connect param, so no session pin existed and this path never fired.
// The cause was a separate global RF-gain replay. Inference presented as
// observation, corrected in the PR body and left corrected here. (#5402 review.)
//
// The defect below is established by reading the path and by these assertions.
//
// Hl2Backend evaluates these same functions rather than its own copy, so what
// passes here is what the radio runs
// (core/backends/hl2/Hl2BandMemoryPolicy.h).
