// The FM repeater and tone controls the Hermes-Lite 2 does NOT have.
//
// Two fields decide whether those controls are live, and on this radio both
// answered wrongly in different ways:
//
//   * hasFmRepeaterOffset was never declared, so it INHERITED the struct's
//     permissive default (true) and the offset spin, the ±steps and the simplex
//     button came up enabled. IRadioBackend::setSliceRepeaterOffsetDir and
//     setSliceFmRepeaterOffset are virtuals with empty bodies and Hl2Backend
//     overrides neither, so those controls moved a number that reached nothing.
//
//   * fmTonePresentation WAS declared, as Legacy — the capability map's row was
//     wrong about this half. Legacy is the value that fills the tone-mode combo
//     from legacyFmToneModes(), i.e. it offers CTCSS ENCODE, on a backend whose
//     transmit chain is a hand-written phasing SSB modulator.
//
// WHY THESE TWO AND NOT FM ITSELF. Nothing here says the HL2 cannot RECEIVE FM;
// it can, and this test asserts that it still declares FM receive-only rather
// than absent. What is withdrawn is a transmit-side control surface for a mode
// the backend already refuses to key in.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE TARGET. Same reason tests.cmake gives beside
// hl2_pan_limits_declaration_test: the fake-radio fixture that would naturally
// carry an HL2 seam assertion — hl2_backend_test — is retired inside a
// commented block, so an assertion written there would be compiled by nothing
// and green forever, and "a declaration must not be pinned only inside
// something that does not build."
//
// SOCKET-FREE. Constructs a backend and reads capabilities(); binds nothing,
// connects nothing, pumps no event loop, and reaches no radio.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT OBSERVE, said plainly because a declaration test that
// overstates its reach is worse than none:
//
//   1. fmTonePresentation's struct DEFAULT is already Hidden. So the assertion
//      that the HL2 reports Hidden would also pass if the line were deleted
//      entirely. It pins the VALUE, not the fact that it is stated. Nothing
//      reachable from here distinguishes declared-Hidden from inherited-Hidden
//      — that is a property of the source text, and RadioCapabilities.h's
//      "a backend that omits one silently declares it absent" rule is what
//      covers it. hasFmRepeaterOffset does not have that problem: its default
//      is the OPPOSITE value, which is asserted below so the two facts fail
//      separately.
//   2. That the two widgets actually honour these fields. VfoWidget::
//      configureFmToneControls and RxApplet::configureFmToneControls read them
//      directly — a coupling a reader can see in four lines — but reaching it
//      needs a constructed widget, and no test in this tree builds one of
//      these. Nothing here was measured on a radio either.
