// The HL2 transmit level calculations: mic gain, and the forward-power peak hold.
//
// Both fixed controls that were DEAD rather than wrong, which is why the cases
// below lean on the boundaries rather than the middle of the range:
//
//   - Hl2TxDsp::setMicGain had no production caller at all. The Phone applet's
//     MIC slider emitted `transmit set miclevel=`, which a backend with no
//     command plane drops, and nothing bridged it to the modulator. Moving the
//     slider end to end changed nothing on the air.
//   - Forward power was published as the raw instantaneous sample from a 10 Hz
//     I2C instrumentation ADC. On constant-envelope FT8 that reads PEP; on
//     speech it reads ~10 dB low, so the same transmitter measured 6 W on FT8
//     and 1 W on voice and the operator had no way to tell those apart.
//
// Hl2Backend evaluates these same functions rather than its own copy, so what
// passes here is what the radio runs (core/backends/hl2/Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h).
