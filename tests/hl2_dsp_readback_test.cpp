// The DSP read-back: does it report the DSP, or does it report the request?
//
// §8's first "still missing" item exists because `get_state` answers from the
// MODEL, so a control that moves the model and never reaches the DSP reads as
// "the control does nothing" — the hardest symptom to act on, because it is
// indistinguishable from the operator having misunderstood the control.
//
// A read-back is only worth having if it can FAIL to agree with the request.
// So these cases are not "the accessor returns something": they are that the
// value MOVES when the DSP is reconfigured, and that it does NOT move when
// only the request does. A read-back that returned its own input would pass a
// test written the first way and be worthless.
