// #6052, the mid-over half: a transmit block that arrives LATE must not become
// keyed zeros in the middle of an over.
//
// What was measured, on a Hermes-Lite 2 into a dummy load (hl2-lab d167):
// 41 runs of exact-zero TX IQ in 15 of 15 three-second overs, 0.4-27.5 ms
// long. Every run started on a 1024-sample block boundary of the delivered
// stream and the tone's phase carried on across it, so no sample was lost:
// the block was late, the queue was empty when it was due, and the EP2 pacer
// padded the wait with zeros.
//
// This test reproduces that offline. A producer delivers whole Hl2TxDsp blocks
// at the nominal rate, each one late by a bounded amount, and the test reads
// the EP2 packets MetisClient builds for them.
//
// VIRTUAL TIME, NO WALL CLOCK. Time is counted in EP2 samples from the keyed
// edge. One call to buildNextControlPacket() is one pacer tick and advances
// time by one packet; a block is queued on the first tick at or after its
// arrival time. Nothing sleeps and nothing reads a clock, so the figures are
// the same on every run and on every machine.
//
// WHAT IS A MODEL HERE. The lateness schedules are built from the measured
// gap LENGTHS. Where in the over each gap fell was recorded only coarsely, so
// the positions below are chosen, not replayed. On the unprimed queue the
// ten modelled overs read 133.6 ms of keyed zeros against 130.7 ms measured,
// in 42 runs against 28: the same total, with more runs of under 1 ms, which
// are the pacer's packet grid meeting a queue at zero depth.
