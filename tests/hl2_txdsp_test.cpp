// SSB modulator correctness for the Hermes-Lite 2 transmit chain.
//
// The assertion that matters on the air: for USB, a 1 kHz audio tone must leave
// this modulator at -1 kHz of the IQ it hands to the wire, and for LSB at
// +1 kHz.
//
// THAT SIGN LOOKS BACKWARDS AND IS NOT. The HPSDR wire order has the opposite
// handedness to the standard analytic convention, which is why the receive path
// conjugates with -imag() before WDSP sees anything. Transmit carries the same
// correction, so the wire-facing sign is inverted from the textbook one.
//
// This was originally asserted the textbook way, and the test passed while every
// transmission went out on the WRONG SIDEBAND — invisible from inside the
// application, because the panadapter reads the same wire order and therefore
// agreed with it. It took an operator with a second receiver to catch it.
//
// It also pins the rate conversion (24 kHz audio in, 48 kHz IQ out) and the
// mic-gain path, both of which are easy to get subtly wrong in ways that only
// show up as "my audio is quiet" or "my signal is 2 kHz wide".

    // ---- CHARACTERISATION SWEEP: opposite-sideband suppression vs audio frequency ----
    //
    // WHAT THIS IS FOR. Everything above measures the modulator at ONE audio
    // frequency, 1 kHz, where it is at its best. The number that decides
    // whether this modulator is good enough is not that one: it is the
    // suppression at the LOW EDGE of the passband, and it is much worse. This
    // block measures the whole passband and PRINTS EVERY VALUE, so that the
    // shape of the curve is on the record rather than a single flattering
    // point.
    //
    // WHY THE LOW EDGE. Hl2TxDsp's filters are 255 taps with a Blackman window
    // at 48 kHz (designFilters()). A Blackman-windowed design's transition
    // width is about 11*fs/N, roughly 2 kHz here, so a 150 Hz low edge is
    // nowhere near resolved: the analytic prototype still has real gain at
    // -150 Hz, and that gain IS the opposite sideband. The image ratio is
    // |H(+f)| / |H(-f)| of the analytic filter, and near the low edge those two
    // are not far apart.
    //
    // WHY 150 Hz SPECIFICALLY. Hl2Backend::defaultTxPassbandForMode pushes
    // {150, 3000} for DIGU and DIGL -- the modes WSJT-X transmits in. The voice
    // modes get {300, 2700} and sit in a much better part of the curve. So the
    // weakest DEFAULT in this table is also the case that carries FT8.
    //
    // THE WEAKEST DEFAULT IS NOT THE WEAKEST THING THAT SHIPS. The operator can
    // set the passband directly: Hl2Backend::setTxFilter clamps the low edge to
    // [0, kTxAudioMaxHz - 50] and effectiveTxPassband returns that pair verbatim
    // for USB and LSB, so a 100 Hz eSSB edge -- or a 0 Hz one -- reaches this
    // modulator without any mode being unusual. The last two rows of bands[]
    // measure exactly that, and they are worse than any default:
    //
    //                    100 Hz   150 Hz   300 Hz   500 Hz
    //   eSSB 100..4000    11.86    18.21    42.15    78.61
    //   wide    0..4000     7.87    12.09    27.73    68.05
    //
    // Hl2Backend's own eSSB comment asserts that "the 255-tap Blackman prototype
    // keeps a usable skirt across that range". These two rows are the first
    // measurement of that claim, and what they say is that "usable" has to mean
    // something weaker than the voice figure: 11.86 dB at the edge the operator
    // is invited to choose. Whether that is acceptable is a judgement for the
    // thread, not for this test -- the test's job is that the number now exists.
    // Reported by aethersdr-agent on #5741, reproduced here to 0.01 dB.
    //
    // WHAT THE BOUNDS ARE AND ARE NOT.
    //
    //   THE FLOORS ARE PER-ROW, because they are properties of the PASSBAND.
    //   A single pair hoisted over the table would read as a statement about
    //   the modulator, and the eSSB row disproves that reading directly: same
    //   modulator, same taps, same window, 11.86 dB instead of 22.06 because
    //   the edge moved. What sets suppression at a tone is how deep inside the
    //   skirt that tone sits.
    //
    //   The low-edge floor is deliberately far below what the low edge
    //   measures. That figure is a BASELINE BEING RECORDED, not a target being
    //   enforced. Asserting it tightly would freeze today's weakness into the
    //   test and the next chain would have to be bug-compatible with it.
    //
    //   The settled floor is the half that discriminates. Above kSettledFromHz
    //   the windowed design has fully settled and the suppression is set by the
    //   window's sidelobe floor rather than by the transition. A shorter filter
    //   or a window with worse sidelobes shows up here immediately; a floor at
    //   the low edge alone does not see it. Every bound was chosen from the
    //   table this block prints, with margin, on the code as it stands -- see
    //   the commit message.

    //   DIGU/DIGL {150, 3000}:  150 Hz 22.06 dB   200 Hz 30.58 dB
    //                           300 Hz 52.26 dB   1 kHz  83.10 dB
    //   USB/LSB   {300, 2700}:  300 Hz 72.43 dB   500 Hz 76.26 dB
    //                           1 kHz  87.15 dB
    //
    // Two of those were, until this block ran, DERIVED AND NEVER MEASURED --
    // the 22 dB and 30.6 dB low-edge figures. They hold: the measurement lands
    // on 22.06 and 30.58.
    //
    // THE 1 kHz VOICE FIGURE HAS INDEPENDENT PROVENANCE, AND IT IS NOT A
    // HARDWARE MEASUREMENT. An earlier revision of this paragraph called it
    // one. It is not, and the distinction is the whole reason to state the
    // provenance rather than the number:
    //
    //   Run `d87-ssb-tone-ab`. The peer is `hpsdrsim` on 127.0.0.1 -- NETWORK
    //   loopback to a simulator. No RF anywhere, no transmitter keyed, no
    //   radio in the path at any point. The instrument is
    //   `streams/bench-runner/tools/ep2_sideband_ratio.py`, reading the EP2
    //   wire: the IQ this backend actually handed to the socket.
    //
    //   Steady 1 kHz tone, TWELVE full-level overs, 87.15-87.19 dB with a
    //   0.04 dB spread. (Sixteen overs were run. The other four are at
    //   -20 dBFS and read 87.13 and 85.98, outside the range, so quoting
    //   sixteen against these bounds would be quoting a spread that does not
    //   exist.)
    //
    // This sweep's USB row lands at 87.15 dB, inside that range.
    //
    // WHAT THE AGREEMENT ACTUALLY BUYS, since neither measurement touches a
    // radio: d87 reads the wire AFTER MetisProtocol::ep2WriteTxIq has packed
    // the samples into signed 16-bit, and this block reads the modulator's
    // output BEFORE it. They agree to better than 0.01 dB at 1 kHz. So the
    // wire packing contributes nothing measurable at 1 kHz -- which is a real
    // result, and one this block could not reach on its own, because it never
    // links MetisProtocol.
    //
    // Nor is the agreement confined to 1 kHz. The same bench family swept three
    // tones and recorded {500: 76.26, 1000: 87.15, 2000: 100.17}; this sweep
    // reads 76.26, 87.15 and 100.15. Agreement to 0.02 dB at the worst of the
    // three.
    //
    // (aethersdr-agent asked, on #5741, where this figure came from: every
    // other number in the block could be re-derived from the tree and this one
    // could not, and a hardware-sounding claim sat oddly beside the block's own
    // "nothing here touches a radio". The suspicion was right on both counts --
    // the count was wrong AND it was never hardware. A comment that cannot be
    // checked ages into a fact nobody can retire, which is exactly what this
    // one had started to do.)
    //
    // AND THE FLOAT ARITHMETIC IS NOT THE LIMIT ANYWHERE IN THE TABLE. An
    // independent double-precision evaluation of the same filter design agrees
    // with every row of this sweep to better than 0.02 dB, including the rows
    // above 100 dB. The float taps and the float accumulator in
    // processAudioBlock are therefore not what caps the suppression; the window
    // is. That matters for the migration argument, because it means the ceiling
    // moves if and only if the filter design moves.
    //
    // MUTATION-CHECKED, which is the only thing that makes a passing bound
    // worth anything. Three degradations of designFilters() were tried against
    // this sweep:
    //
    //   kTaps 255 -> 127      DIGU low edge 22.1 -> 7.9 dB, settled 83 -> 29 dB.
    //                         BOTH floors go red.
    //   Blackman -> Hann      low edge IMPROVES (22.1 -> 40.6 dB: the main lobe
    //                         narrows) and the settled band degrades to 63.7 dB.
    //                         The low-edge floor PASSES it. kSettledFloorDb is
    //                         the only thing that catches it.
    //   Blackman -> no window low edge 23.5 dB, settled 33.1 dB. Again the
    //                         low-edge floor passes and kSettledFloorDb catches.
    //   kTaps 255 -> 191      a 25% trim, not a gross one. DIGU low edge 14.0 dB,
    //                         settled 63.4 dB. Both floors go red -- and EVERY
    //                         OTHER ASSERTION IN THIS FILE STILL PASSES it,
    //                         including the 1 kHz >30 dB checks and the 5 kHz
    //                         rejection check. This is the case that shows the
    //                         sweep sees something nothing else here sees.
    //
    // Three of the four plausible degradations are invisible to a low-edge
    // bound, and one of the four is invisible to everything else in this file.
    // That is the whole reason there are two floors rather than one, and it is
    // why a single "worst point in the sweep" assertion would have been
    // decoration.
    //
    // NOT MEASURED HERE: nothing in this block touches a radio. No transmitter
    // is keyed, no simulator runs, no network socket opens. These are the
    // modulator's own emitted IQ read directly in wire order, which is a
    // stronger instrument than a loopback (two conjugations cancel in a
    // loopback) but a weaker one than an over-the-air measurement with a second
    // receiver, because it cannot see anything the PA or the wire does.

    // ── #4796 review: the reduction half must RELEASE — it may not latch ────
    //
    // Gating only the ALC's INCREASE branch (leaving `reducing` free to act) is
    // the smaller edit and is wrong: once a loud block pulls the gain down,
    // nothing can raise it again within the over, so a client sliding back down
    // stays attenuated at whatever the loudest block called for. That is
    // path-dependent gain — #4796's own defect class, mirrored. Expressing the
    // bypass as a unity CEILING instead leaves the gain free to release.
    //
    // This case is the discriminator between those two shapes. It passes on a
    // total bypass and on the ceiling; it fails ~21 dB wide on an
    // increase-gated ALC.
    //
    // HALF OF THAT RATIONALE HAS RETIRED, and the half that has not is the
    // reason this case is untouched by the unity-ceiling change.
    //
    // It used to be the discriminator for a second thing as well: the hold being
    // made mic-path-only (`!clientLeveled` in processAudioBlock's `held`). There
    // is no hold any more — it was deleted outright with the ALC's makeup half,
    // because under a unity ceiling a quiet block wants target = 1.0, so after
    // any reduction `reducing` is false and a hold would strand the gain exactly
    // as described above. So that discriminator has nothing left to discriminate
    // between, and the paragraph is kept as history rather than as a live claim.
    //
    // WHAT SURVIVES IS THE PROOF THAT THE UNITY CEILING CHANGED NOTHING HERE. On
    // the client path the ceiling was already 1.0 and `held` was already false,
    // so every assertion below reads the same before and after — which is what
    // makes this case the evidence that a change to the mic path is a no-op on
    // TCI/DAX.
    //
    // THE QUIET LEG IS STILL DELIBERATELY WHERE IT IS: -70 dBFS times this
    // case's 10x mic gain is -50 dBFS at the ALC's measurement point, which was
    // under the old -45 dBFS hold threshold. Do not raise it. It is what keeps
    // the case able to catch a hold reappearing, on either path, by any route.
    //
    // One continuous transmission: full scale, then -70 dBFS held for four
    // release time constants. The tail must match the same level keyed fresh.
